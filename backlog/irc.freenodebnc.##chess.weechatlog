2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[04:04:23] Heh, most players aren't intimidated by the London. But you can certainly get a good attack with it if your opponent is not careful
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:07:15] what is most players?
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:07:25] 1200 elo / 1500 glicko2?
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[04:07:56] I don't know. Master players certainly aren't intimidated by it much, though
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:08:02] I mean just the perception that I'm intimidating them, even if they aren't
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:08:09] lol I'm not playing against masters
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[04:08:16] And I think club players are more likely to roll their eyes if you play the London. Some people find it boring
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:08:28] not playing club either!
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:08:32] You overestimate me :p
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[04:09:31] Also, elo and glicko don't work like that. You can have an elo system where ratings start at 1500. It's a somewhat arbitrary number.
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:10:02] yeah I know
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:10:15] take what I said and put it in lichess 1500
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:11:25] gotta start somewhere and I don't want to go for sicilian - I just don't
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:11:45] not right now anyway
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[04:12:57] Probably a sane idea, yeah
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[04:14:24] once I cut down my rate of undefended pieces, then maybe I'll try more
2018-09-19 12:31:40	Garf	[04:57:08] gee, now random people attacking me on reddit because I dislike Kislik's book
2018-09-19 12:31:40	Garf	[04:57:23] well, maybe it's just another alt account like last time

2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[05:51:55] yeah, that reaction to your review is pretty bizarre.

2018-09-19 12:31:40	mursu	[05:58:24] this is just bizarre
2018-09-19 12:31:40	mursu	[05:58:53] why do people take this shit so personally online
2018-09-19 12:31:40	Garf	[06:08:13] I mean he's literally attacking the people that aren't giving it 5 stars on Amazon
2018-09-19 12:31:40	mursu	[06:12:26] is it the author or?
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[06:13:00] Probably him or one of his friends, or maybe a deranged fanboy
2018-09-19 12:31:40	mursu	[06:13:28] I should pick up some chess literature
2018-09-19 12:31:40	Garf	[06:14:16] he went off the rails on reddit before
2018-09-19 12:31:40	artefact	[06:22:26] the 50 chess mysteries of the arabian knights is amazing. if you're into retrograde analysis
2018-09-19 12:31:40	artefact	[06:22:40] probably not the best for pure improvement, but the problems are just so much fun and novel
2018-09-19 12:31:40	mursu	[06:24:20] I'm maybe looking for general improvement
2018-09-19 12:31:40	furrykef	[06:45:30] I like how this math problem has robots and laser cannons. Math lets you do cool things, but that still doesn't make math cool.
2018-09-19 12:31:40	artefact	[06:48:54] alright, the puzzle dataset is complete. now for some cool graphs. /me delves in gnuplot manual
2018-09-19 12:31:40	artefact	[07:18:05] yep. it's right up there in obscureness with autotools
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[07:21:24] I'm not even going to bother getting into that Garf. reddit is a weird place so it's not worth it
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[07:21:32] downvotes also aren't conducive to effort
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[07:21:55] you can be the most reasonable, with facts etc (or universe forbid, opinion) - and downvote.
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[07:21:59] probably all bots
2018-09-19 12:31:40	Garf	[07:22:26] eyeoh: from the later links I posted, I think it was an alt of the author
2018-09-19 12:31:40	eyeoh	[07:24:44] hmm I need to get ad blocking working again in safari 12
2018-09-19 12:31:41	eyeoh	[07:24:47] pastebin is not good
2018-09-19 12:31:41	Garf	[07:27:21] use firefox
2018-09-19 12:31:41	mursu	[07:28:46] and don't use pastebin
2018-09-19 12:31:41	Garf	[07:30:26] "why not both"
2018-09-19 12:31:41	eyeoh	[07:31:16] I do use firefox but try to limit it on laptop due to battery drain
2018-09-19 12:31:41	eyeoh	[07:31:30] ptpb is better, I think

2018-09-19 12:51:57	eyeoh	I ride a Brompton; definitely not a sport bike (unless you go silly and configure it to be one)
2018-09-19 12:52:13	artefact	i run an old crap steel frame with 700x23c tires
2018-09-19 12:52:20	furrykef	Yeah, the pin didn't give me a forced win. But it still helped me win.
2018-09-19 12:52:24	+Momentum	i was confused when you used lead-up and halfs
2018-09-19 12:52:26	eyeoh	it's just a time thing; going distance without great speed isn't hard if you just keep doing it regularly
2018-09-19 12:52:59	eyeoh	I'm planning a "half marathon" for my 100th Pennyboard session
2018-09-19 12:53:05	+Momentum	furrykef: i'd call it removing the defender
2018-09-19 12:53:11	eyeoh	I've done 97 sessions since before christmas last year
2018-09-19 12:53:43	eyeoh	only 590km on bike so far this year
2018-09-19 12:53:50	+Momentum	eyeoh: i ran an average speed but yeah
2018-09-19 12:53:51	eyeoh	2100 last year
2018-09-19 12:54:20	+Momentum	590km in one session or the whole year?
2018-09-19 12:54:24	eyeoh	5,333 in 2015; and 7300 and 7200 in 2014 and 2013
2018-09-19 12:54:28	eyeoh	year!
2018-09-19 12:54:47	eyeoh	if I did 590km in one go, I'd be posting tens of thousands of kilometres and telling you :p
2018-09-19 12:54:56	+Momentum	haha
2018-09-19 12:55:01	+Momentum	is it possible though? :P
2018-09-19 12:55:06	eyeoh	friend has done that kind of distance over several days
2018-09-19 12:55:11	eyeoh	audax or randonneuring
2018-09-19 12:55:12	+Momentum	i'd go for it if i find a good company
2018-09-19 12:55:20	eyeoh	yeah it's about the journey
2018-09-19 12:55:32	eyeoh	let me find his blog
2018-09-19 12:55:50	eyeoh	dang; offline
2018-09-19 12:55:50	+Momentum	the roads are terrible here though :/
2018-09-19 12:57:23	eyeoh	car-centrism does that; but that's a topic I'll never stop talking about so I won't start :)
2018-09-19 12:57:37	+Momentum	also i did almost the same as you with foot a year ago ~10km
2018-09-19 12:58:33	eyeoh	I do want to do another 10k but I don't want to do it until I have good 5ks under my belt
2018-09-19 12:58:41	eyeoh	I want to post a sub hour on the 2nd attempt ever
2018-09-19 12:58:50	eyeoh	I was hoping my first would do it but ah; too ambitious
2018-09-19 12:59:25	eyeoh	I think if I can get consistent 5:30/km for 5k, then I should manage 6:00/k for 10k
2018-09-19 12:59:46	eyeoh	I probably just need to stop looking at the clock for starters and just run 5k more regularly
2018-09-19 13:00:07	+Momentum	sounds fair
2018-09-19 13:01:26	+Momentum	a 24H of chess is also not bad
2018-09-19 13:01:45	mursu	sounds like a rough marathon

2018-09-19 13:09:31	eyeoh	but for now I'll focus on rapid and maybe classical if I have time
2018-09-19 13:09:50	+Momentum	personally i don't like playing rapid or classical online, i feel bored
2018-09-19 13:10:08	+Momentum	well, i've never played classical in my life
2018-09-19 13:10:09	eyeoh	you're probably more experienced than me
2018-09-19 13:10:13	artefact	but you don't when playing 90+30 over the board?
2018-09-19 13:10:14	eyeoh	I still have to think in openings
2018-09-19 13:10:17	artefact	oh
2018-09-19 13:11:01	+Momentum	the longest i've ever done was like 15+10
2018-09-19 13:11:05	eyeoh	I'm not even sure if 90+30 exists in my city
2018-09-19 13:11:08	+Momentum	and that's online lol
2018-09-19 13:11:39	eyeoh	lichess's quick pair button for classic is 15+15
2018-09-19 13:11:52	+Momentum	artefact: 90+30 i'll probably just lose my mind either way
2018-09-19 13:12:07	eyeoh	what do you play? 3+0?
2018-09-19 13:12:15	artefact	it's pretty standard in fidé classical tournaments
2018-09-19 13:12:21	+Momentum	yes i can handle everything bellow 10+0
2018-09-19 13:12:30	eyeoh	yeah so where does 15+10 come from?
2018-09-19 13:12:32	+Momentum	yes i'm aware of that
2018-09-19 13:12:46	eyeoh	only a 6 or so minute difference to 15+15
2018-09-19 13:12:52	+Momentum	that's a chess tournament we organized here in ##chess
2018-09-19 13:13:21	+Momentum	i think it is 15+10?
2018-09-19 13:13:26	+Momentum	or am i mistaken
2018-09-19 13:13:37	mursu	when is the next ##chess tourney
2018-09-19 13:13:38	+Momentum	where's the freaking link
2018-09-19 13:13:50	+Momentum	mursu: you mean marathon?
2018-09-19 13:13:51	artefact	8 months ago
2018-09-19 13:14:00	mursu	:(
2018-09-19 13:14:32	+Momentum	oh the next heh
2018-09-19 13:14:44	eyeoh	back when I played the most amount of chess (still only a couple to a few times a week), it was untimed heh
2018-09-19 13:14:46	+Momentum	was it 15+10 artefact?
2018-09-19 13:14:53	eyeoh	wish we had clocks back then; these days clocks are easy with lichess
2018-09-19 13:16:45	eyeoh	15+10 for world rapid champs https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8709-time-controls-for-fide-world-events.html
2018-09-19 13:16:46	+Momentum	clocks oh phones as well
2018-09-19 13:17:38	eyeoh	yeah that's what I meant
2018-09-19 13:17:43	eyeoh	the Lichess app clock is good
2018-09-19 13:18:00	+Momentum	15+10 is a comfortable TC
2018-09-19 13:18:06	eyeoh	but back in 2001, 2002.. we thought about buying our own or getting the library to buy one
2018-09-19 13:18:27	eyeoh	yeah so why does Lichess use 15+15 for the quick game >_<
2018-09-19 13:18:38	eyeoh	what does chess.com offer?
2018-09-19 13:18:55	artefact	ways to spend money
2018-09-19 13:18:55	+Momentum	those are just the quick pairing TCs
2018-09-19 13:19:07	eyeoh	15|10 apparently https://www.chess.com/article/view/interesting-chess-data-time-controls-and-game-results
2018-09-19 13:19:13	+Momentum	you can customize it
2018-09-19 13:19:24	+Momentum	if you're seeking a game
2018-09-19 13:19:26	eyeoh	yeah but quick pairings mean a greater pool, I imagine
2018-09-19 13:19:33	+Momentum	indeed
2018-09-19 13:19:36	eyeoh	defaults in software should always be good
2018-09-19 13:19:46	eyeoh	so I'm confused as to why they go for 15+15 instead of 15+10
2018-09-19 13:19:52	eyeoh	maybe they think it looks better
2018-09-19 13:20:17	+Momentum	idk
2018-09-19 13:20:28	eyeoh	and I'd want to get used to just one control rather than two slightly different ones
2018-09-19 13:21:29	eyeoh	I suppose I should make an chess.com account now rather than later
2018-09-19 13:21:54	mursu	don't do it
2018-09-19 13:22:04	mursu	it'll swallow your soul
2018-09-19 13:22:40	+Momentum	chess.com account is def. good for their /live TV other than that it's just a piece of shit

2018-09-19 13:23:45	eyeoh	I have both now
2018-09-19 13:23:52	eyeoh	is a 3rd one necessary?
2018-09-19 13:24:08	mursu	yeah
2018-09-19 13:24:11	mursu	internet chess club
2018-09-19 13:24:13	jmaister	ICC
2018-09-19 13:24:31	+Momentum	ICC is paid or am i mistaken?
2018-09-19 13:24:39	mursu	it is paid, yes
2018-09-19 13:24:58	+Momentum	FICS best
2018-09-19 13:25:10	mursu	you need that one too
2018-09-19 13:25:18	+Momentum	chess24 too?
2018-09-19 13:25:21	mursu	all of them
2018-09-19 13:25:31	+Momentum	to play peter svidler sometime
2018-09-19 13:25:49	mursu	remember to buy Chessmaster X: Grandmaster Edition to play online with that too
2018-09-19 13:25:55	eyeoh	so no free parts for ICC?
2018-09-19 13:26:50	eyeoh	odd; why does it need my full name
2018-09-19 13:27:23	Jik	FICS is best
2018-09-19 13:27:42	Jik	i like the text ui
2018-09-19 13:28:00	Jik	a lot easier to seek certain games than with modern browser guis
2018-09-19 13:28:05	eyeoh	libre works for me
2018-09-19 13:28:18	Jik	lichess could implement a command line for seeking games
2018-09-19 13:28:34	Jik	and fingering players
2018-09-19 13:28:51	mursu	don't finger your opponent without their consent
2018-09-19 13:29:15	eyeoh	agadmator only lists chess.com and Lichess so that's likely good enough for me for now
2018-09-19 13:29:33	eyeoh	I'll try and check out the aforementioned though
2018-09-19 13:31:05	eyeoh	that time controls report by chess.com is quite interesting

2018-09-19 13:59:32	eyeoh	"although it is thought to be more solid and less dynamic than either of those openings. It often leads to good endgames for Black, who has the better pawn structure."
2018-09-19 13:59:32	eyeoh	wiki agrees with me :p
2018-09-19 13:59:45	eyeoh	well you gotta chose *some* openings
2018-09-19 13:59:53	eyeoh	which ones for you?
2018-09-19 14:01:21	mursu	as white I usually play Queen's Gambit as black I use Slav defense for 1. d4, d5 2. c4, or just Giuco Piano on e4
2018-09-19 14:01:41	mursu	though I'm not really hot on e4, e5
2018-09-19 14:02:33	mursu	maybe 1. e4, c5, but the sicilian has a lot of theory so it's a bit difficult for a beginner like me
2018-09-19 14:05:50	eyeoh	yeah
2018-09-19 14:06:32	eyeoh	I think I should have plenty to work with for c4/d4 for white and just move random pieces after that

2018-09-19 14:07:40	eyeoh	on rematches, it means a different game from the start
2018-09-19 14:08:17	eyeoh	just by sheer fact that most around provisional go for the 4th and 5th ranks
2018-09-19 14:08:32	eyeoh	need that spice
2018-09-19 14:08:37	furrykef	I used to play the Caro-Kann, but nowadays I opt for the Scandinavian instead, because it's more likely to result in positions I like

She has stated preferring to learn an opponent's style so she can play intentionally against him or her rather than playing "objective" chess.[220] In her 2002 victory (at 25 minutes time control) over Kasparov, she deliberately chose a line Kasparov had used against Vladimir Kramnik, employing the strategy of forcing the opponent to

Kasparov's response was inadequate and he soon found himself in an inferior position.[139] In an interview regarding playing against computers she said, "Chess is 30 to 40% psychology.

2018-09-20 12:33:45	eyeoh	[07:08:58] I started a couple of correspondence games
2018-09-20 12:33:45	eyeoh	[07:09:06] 3 days per move
2018-09-20 12:33:45	furrykef	[07:44:39] eyeoh: Don't forget that in correspondence you can do anything but consult with someone else or use an engine
2018-09-20 12:33:45	furrykef	[07:44:48] You can even use an opening book
2018-09-20 12:33:46	furrykef	[07:45:30] I usually write down my thoughts when I analyze a position in correspondence
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:05:59] I just snatched victory from the jaws of defeat https://lichess.org/8aaKVOj7
2018-09-20 12:33:46	mursu	[09:22:00] white had that in the bag :(
2018-09-20 12:33:46	mursu	[09:22:20] then he took it out of the bag and put it in black's bag :(
2018-09-20 12:33:46	furrykef	[09:33:25] This morning I stalemated with KQvK (there were a couple pieces on the board but they weren't relevant)
2018-09-20 12:33:46	furrykef	[09:33:30] *couple other
2018-09-20 12:33:46	furrykef	[09:33:56] Normally I can do that endgame in my sleep, but somehow my brain kinda short-circuited
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:40:27] mursu: hehe yes
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:40:30] I was ready to resign
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:41:00] furrykef: ah yes; always worth playing out rapid/blitz just in case of stalemate
2018-09-20 12:33:46	mursu	[09:41:00] good thing you didn't
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:41:07] I was *so* close
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:41:18] time to never resign again; and do it the Magnus Carlsen way
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:41:38] how many pieces was I down.. like 3 pawns or something
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:42:54] it felt like 3 pawns
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[09:43:51] time to undo that mess and try a classical
2018-09-20 12:33:46	xcombelle	[09:48:50] I wonder if my opponent is not aware it is his turn
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[10:10:25] classical feels soooo relaxing after rapid
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[10:10:45] oh, opponent resigned
2018-09-20 12:33:46	eyeoh	[10:10:55] I had a chance earlier to claim victory cause they dropped out but I'm nice and just waited
2018-09-20 12:33:46	furrykef	[10:34:41] yeah, I just wait for their clock to run out unless I have such a crushing lead the outcome isn't in doubt

2018-09-20 14:36:38	cacheyourdreams	Ah. Did you get that paper reviewed?
2018-09-20 14:36:39	qed	I want it to be 10^-2 today I convinced myself that 10^-6 should be easy to prove
2018-09-20 14:36:51	qed	no cacheyourdreams 
2018-09-20 14:37:01	qed	I procrastinate
2018-09-20 14:37:04	cacheyourdreams	heh, sounds productive then :P

2018-09-20 14:37:34	qed	it looks like a nice paper although the authors managed to write their result wrongfully in the abstract lol
2018-09-20 14:37:59	artefact	we all do
2018-09-20 14:38:02	artefact	i do it, a lot
2018-09-20 14:38:08	qed	cacheyourdreams, how have you been my friend?
2018-09-20 14:39:23	cacheyourdreams	I'm alright, starting a new job on Monday and moving to a new place on Sunday, heh, so it's going to be a little hectic

2018-09-20 14:40:25	artefact	1.d4 is a pretty stress free move

2018-09-20 14:41:27	xcombelle	boring game, probably for stronger player than me
2018-09-20 14:46:11	furrykef	The only boring games are when your position is hopeless or you have a crushing advantage
2018-09-20 14:46:30	furrykef	If neither is true and your game is still boring, you're not thinking hard enough
2018-09-20 14:51:37	--	zmv is now known as notzmv
2018-09-20 14:51:49	notzmv	moin moin
2018-09-20 14:52:22	Garf	I squeezed a guy to defeat yesterday. Felt great.
2018-09-20 14:52:34	Garf	In  a Sicilian too (made it a closed one).
2018-09-20 14:53:01	furrykef	I like the "boa constrictor" style. I intend to study Petrosian and Karpov eventually.
2018-09-20 14:53:22	notzmv	p e t r o s i a n 
2018-09-20 14:53:36	furrykef	problem, notzmv?
2018-09-20 14:53:46	notzmv	no
2018-09-20 14:53:49	notzmv	petrosian dank
2018-09-20 14:53:57	notzmv	why would I ever have a problem with petrosian mfw
2018-09-20 14:53:59	notzmv	ouo
2018-09-20 14:54:05	artefact	BCIs aren't what they're made up to be
2018-09-20 14:54:17	furrykef	Well I have no idea what you meant by w r i t i n g   l i k e   t h i s
2018-09-20 14:54:41	furrykef	BCIs?
2018-09-20 14:54:49	Jik	it is a way to  e m p h a s i z e  what you want to say
2018-09-20 14:55:01	Jik	and you can't just write "petrosian" wihtout emphasizing as if he was just a mortal
2018-09-20 14:55:15	artefact	she's pretty chill unless she thinks you're going to feed her, then she's all teeth
2018-09-20 14:55:42	artefact	sadly she seems to have been stuck in that latter state for a while
2018-09-20 14:56:47	notzmv	see
2018-09-20 14:56:51	notzmv	Jik: knows what's up
2018-09-20 14:57:30	furrykef	Of course I also admire the crazy attacking style of players like Morphy and Tal, but I also know I'll never be able to play anything like them. It's like swinging around a spiked club in Team Fortress 2... if you don't know what you're doing, you're just gonna hurt yourself.
2018-09-20 14:58:16	notzmv	IMO both petrosian and karpov are severely underrated by most chess students
2018-09-20 14:58:29	notzmv	also the patriarch ouo
2018-09-20 14:59:39	xcombelle	I just did this problem https://lichess.org/training/74838 It is cute in my opinion
2018-09-20 14:59:40	notzmv	botvinnik for real created modern chess
2018-09-20 15:01:12	+Momentum	1.d4 is boring unless your opponent plays e5
2018-09-20 15:02:55	Garf	I signed up for the national blitz championships.
2018-09-20 15:03:10	Garf	I'm sure that with my 1500 lichess it's going to be a good learning experience :P
2018-09-20 15:03:39	+Momentum	where is that?
2018-09-20 15:03:42	notzmv	>d4 is boring unless your opponent plays e5
2018-09-20 15:03:44	notzmv	BAN
2018-09-20 15:03:55	Garf	50th percentile of current registrations is 1850 FIDE Elo
2018-09-20 15:04:20	+Momentum	englund best by test
2018-09-20 15:04:35	notzmv	d4 is decent, but I don't like weakening d4 much, I sometimes end up in trouble against g6 memes
2018-09-20 15:04:46	notzmv	so I do the english which is best it's known
2018-09-20 15:05:19	+Momentum	you're not weakening d4 by putting a pawn on d4
2018-09-20 15:05:29	Garf	also this is FIDE rated
2018-09-20 15:05:39	+Momentum	where is that Garf?
2018-09-20 15:05:41	eyeoh	https://lichess.org/tv + make sounds pentatonic. so nice
2018-09-20 15:05:41	Garf	so I'll have an official FIDE blitz by next week
2018-09-20 15:05:46	Garf	.be
2018-09-20 15:06:02	artefact	wallonie or flandres?
2018-09-20 15:06:24	notzmv	Momentum: eh aren't you though
2018-09-20 15:06:24	furrykef	xcombelle: Both moves seemed pretty obvious to me... I was wondering if I was missing something
2018-09-20 15:06:36	notzmv	I mean, unless you play like a london or some other shit like that
2018-09-20 15:06:37	+Momentum	notzmv: i don't see it
2018-09-20 15:07:33	Garf	the tournament is on the flemish side though close to Brussels
2018-09-20 15:07:34	Garf	players seem to be from all over the country
2018-09-20 15:07:34	notzmv	I mean as in that d4 is easier to counter with say, c5 or putting pressure on d4 like on a KID
2018-09-20 15:08:34	notzmv	black doesn't get to play against the d-pawn in an english
2018-09-20 15:08:50	xcombelle	furrykef I started to analyse 1.Txg2 for a small amount of time before having the epiphany to shuffle the moves
2018-09-20 15:09:16	artefact	rook.
2018-09-20 15:09:35	Garf	This kind of pawn pin is common. I lost a game like this.
2018-09-20 15:09:52	xcombelle	yes 1.Rxg2 (I'm french)
2018-09-20 15:10:05	notzmv	d'accord

2018-09-20 15:10:49	Garf	I just played Rxc5

2018-09-20 16:12:02	+Momentum	RIP
2018-09-20 16:12:05	Garf	especially if they update it with my patches
2018-09-20 16:12:09	Garf	but the website is ugh
2018-09-20 16:12:39	Garf	unfortunately the Cordova framework the app is written in can't target desktop (wtf)
2018-09-20 16:12:57	+Momentum	wut? Cordova
2018-09-20 16:13:00	+Momentum	holy smokes

2018-09-20 16:13:15	+Momentum	thought that was a native Java app
2018-09-20 16:13:30	Garf	lul no
2018-09-20 16:13:39	Garf	the engine is native, but that's C++
2018-09-20 16:13:56	Garf	everything else is JS/CSS/HTML
2018-09-20 16:14:08	+Momentum	still solid though
2018-09-20 16:14:16	+Momentum	i underestimated Cordova once

2018-09-20 16:16:50	furrykef	Electron only targets desktop and Cordova only targets mobile. This greatly annoys me, though it is possible to jump through some hoops and target both.
2018-09-20 16:17:16	+Momentum	react native?

2018-09-20 16:17:54	artefact	the app is great. if only it showed me the correct puzzle, not ones i solved days ago
2018-09-20 16:18:08	furrykef	React Native only does mobile too.
2018-09-20 16:18:18	+Momentum	hmm
2018-09-20 16:18:21	notzmv	it's called spaced repetition you plebs :^)
2018-09-20 16:18:22	artefact	still lots of good features, esp. when offline
2018-09-20 16:18:23	furrykef	Both React Native and Cordova can do UWP, but, well, fuck that shit.

2018-09-20 16:23:45	+Momentum	we were talking about lichess tactics training i assumed

2018-09-20 16:25:33	qed	cacheyourdreams, I forgot to ask about the new job, is it a software developer job and if so in what language will you work?
2018-09-20 16:25:35	furrykef	I use (intentional) SRS at ChessTempo. It works pretty well, I think
2018-09-20 16:26:01	+Momentum	MFW cordova official website is featuring sparkchess and not lichess
2018-09-20 16:26:03	cacheyourdreams	qed, ya, it'll be Java mostly to start with, but a bit of a mix
2018-09-20 16:26:23	eyeoh	since you all have been talking about reddit or stuff, I've been mucking around in chess
2018-09-20 16:26:26	+Momentum	wow everyone here is a software developer
2018-09-20 16:26:28	eyeoh	what is there to discuss?

2018-09-20 17:55:29	artefact	bc is good. some function names are a bit weird
2018-09-20 18:01:27	artefact	also it doesn't support non-integer exponents
2018-09-20 18:01:45	artefact	you have to use e(b*l(a)) instead, which gets annoying and unreadable
2018-09-20 18:17:46	xcombelle	why use bc when you can use python ?
2018-09-20 18:18:15	eyeoh	bc -l does floating point without a .
2018-09-20 18:18:26	eyeoh	1/3 as opposed to 1/3.
2018-09-20 18:18:44	eyeoh	alias bc='bc -ql'
2018-09-20 18:18:52	artefact	-l just imports the standard math library afaik

2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[03:15:40] What's that site for practicing an opening book? Not chessable, the free one.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[03:17:02] Maybe it was memchess.com...
2018-09-21 13:32:10	eyeoh	[03:58:29] ..lichess?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[04:08:55] No, it doesn't have an opening book practice feature
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[04:09:05] Unless they added one recently...
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[04:09:14] (I believe it did have one but it got removed for not being useful)
2018-09-21 13:32:10	eyeoh	[04:34:12] ah ok
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[04:36:21] https://lichess.org/3vVwICdD  Think I played a pretty nice game her

2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[06:39:40] I'm just doing review now... so a bit of everything
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[06:40:02] I'm gonna take a short break from learning new material
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[06:40:25] This stuff has gotten tricky enough that I need to slow down a bit
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[06:44:49] I'm wondering whether I should take the calculus course next or the statistics course. I'm definitely gonna need both

2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:17:00] http://milesmathis.com/euclid.html  I was thinking of e-mailing this guy and arguing with him about imaginary numbers
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:17:32] But I just saw he also wrote a paper claiming that Stephen Hawking died and was replaced by a puppet (this was before the real Hawking died)
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:17:40] So... I'm staying away from this kind of crankery
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:18:15] I don't know whether he was serious about Hawking but it's in very poor taste anyhow
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:19:17] http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis  oh, wow, this guy is a total nutbar. I'm staying the *hell* away, then.

2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:25:25] Come on, what are you saying. His book has great reviews.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:25:34] As good as Applying Logic in Chess.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:26:03] Ok I take that back. Only 3.5
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:27:46] All the critics get attacked.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:27:48] The similarity is striking.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:27:58] That must've been what confused my feeble incel mind.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[09:30:16] Does this mean you're not a fan of Applying Logic in Chess?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:31:27] I'm on the fence about the book itself.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:32:11] It's 9 bucks on Kindle. It's worth that, for sure.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:34:20] There's like 0 real research on chess education, so anyone can say whatever they  want of course.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:34:38] And if one student turns out to be successful, point to it and say "see".
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:35:10] Kotov was a GM. Therefor, his analysis method is sound.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:35:32] (I'm bringing that up because I think many strong players have said now they disgree with it)
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:36:46] Now, I like Move First Think Later because a) the author doesn't really claim he knows anything b) he's at least trying to apply falsifiability to other approaches
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[09:39:45] furrykef: do you still use chessable?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	xcombelle	[09:42:26] https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Miles_Mathis is fun
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:07:23] Garf: Bought a book there a few days ago, why?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:07:58] I have Think Like a Grandmaster... I'm not too impressed with it. I guess 'cause the tree of analysis is obvious enough to anyone who's programmed a minimax algorithm.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[10:09:10] furrykef: do you have any of the middlegame/strategy books?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:09:58] Yeah, a couple.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[10:10:42] the improve your pattern recognition one? do they work well?
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:12:44] I have Mastering Chess Middlegames, Forcing Chess Moves, and Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition. MCM is the only one I've tried so far and I'm not impressed with it, but that's because the puzzles don't include any variations... the text might, but they're not covered in the SRS at all.
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:13:13] I should hurry up and make sure Forcing Chess Moves isn't the same way while I can still refund it
2018-09-21 13:32:10	Garf	[10:15:03] forcing chess moves looked rather tactical so I wasn't really afraid of that problem there
2018-09-21 13:32:10	qed	[10:18:12] some one claims that he proved the Riemann hypothesis
2018-09-21 13:32:10	furrykef	[10:18:41] Many people claim many things

2018-09-21 13:32:10	qed	[10:22:14] Garf, https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2018/09/21/the-specter-of-simpler-proofs/
2018-09-21 13:32:10	qed	[10:22:26] not only he claims to prove it but he says that it is a simple proof
2018-09-21 13:32:11	furrykef	[10:23:46] Is it a marvelous proof that the margin is too small to contain?
2018-09-21 13:32:11	qed	[10:25:39] :)
2018-09-21 13:32:11	qed	[10:25:53] I am super excited by this lol
2018-09-21 13:32:11	xcombelle	[10:36:05] qed I'm not excited, I would bet it is wrong
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[10:36:45] did he write it in Latin A on a slate in the Mariana Trench?
2018-09-21 13:32:11	emajor	[10:36:57] qed: why did you resign?
2018-09-21 13:32:11	xcombelle	[10:43:37] New Scientist contacted a number of mathematicians to comment on the claimed proof, but all of them declined. Atiyah has produced a number of papers in recent years making remarkable claims which have so far failed to convince his peers. https://www.newscientist.com/article/2180406-famed-mathematician-claims-proof-of-160-year-old-riemann-hypothesis/
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[10:46:44] that's not so promising then

2018-09-21 13:32:11	furrykef	[11:24:09] I always get tripped up on the formula.
2018-09-21 13:32:11	qed	[11:32:20] the life of a mathematician is not an easy one
2018-09-21 13:32:11	qed	[11:33:17] the only reward is a glace into infinity , you start to realize how complex the universe is

2018-09-21 13:32:11	eyeoh	[11:40:03] furrykef: I've heard that statistics is more useful than calculus
2018-09-21 13:32:11	eyeoh	[11:40:14] for tech people at least
2018-09-21 13:32:11	eyeoh	[11:40:21] and sciency people
2018-09-21 13:32:11	eyeoh	[11:40:43] every paper has stats, but how about calculus?
2018-09-21 13:32:11	mursu	[11:41:44] statisticians are the alpha-chads of the math world
2018-09-21 13:32:11	artefact	[11:42:15] i'd argue the opposite
2018-09-21 13:32:11	mursu	[11:42:25] :(
2018-09-21 13:32:11	mursu	[11:42:30] I don't know anything about the math world
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[11:43:27] advanced statistics requires some understanding of calculus
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[11:43:39] that said, everyone in tech or science should be able to *apply* statistics at least
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[11:44:04] to verify a hypothesis, and test improvements
2018-09-21 13:32:11	Garf	[11:44:13] that's why they give doctors stats

2018-09-21 13:32:11	flapz	[11:44:46] to know stats, you must know probability theory, to understand prob. th. you must know Kolmogorov's axiomatic system, to understand Kolmogorov's system you must know measure theory

2018-09-21 13:32:11	artefact	[11:46:25] right... and to know sqrt(2) you must know how the definition of a real number with dedekind cuts? and to know that you need to understand ZF?

2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:20:31] Hi, how can I set up a chess engine to play against itself?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:23:35] what platform?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:23:53] Garf: I don't know. What do you recommend?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:23:58] Linux
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:24:34] Garf: I thought you meant something else. I have windows
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:25:00] Ok. Do you have any chess GUI already?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:25:27] If not, free options are Arena (which can for sure do this) and Lucaschess (didn't use it myself).
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:25:27] Garf: I have Tarrasch GUI, but I can download something else
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:25:34] cutechess-cli is also very good, but it's console only
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:26:11] Get a Stockfish binary.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:26:12] Garf: I need GUI
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:26:34] http://abrok.eu/stockfish/
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:27:00] Garf: Is it also GUI, or just engine?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:27:11] that's the engine you'll want to plug into the GUI
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:27:34] Garf: in Tarrasch I need to switch sides manually if I want to make the engine play against itself, which is quite annoying
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:29:38] Garf: Yeah, but I'm looking for a GUI that will enable me to do it automatically, I already have an engine
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:29:52] Arena should be able to (but I've never used it)
2018-09-21 18:45:40	artefact	[17:30:46] if you want foss, scid vs pc and qutechess can do it too
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:32:16] qutechess is an engine, cutechess is the GUI
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:37:09] Death looked long and hard at the board. The abbot waited to see what long-term, devious strategies were being evolved. Then his opponent tapped a piece with a bony finger. "Remind me again," he said, "how the little horse-shaped ones move."
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[17:37:09] — Small Gods 
2018-09-21 18:45:40	+dutchie	[17:40:13] chessx was the most tolerable gui when I last looked
2018-09-21 18:45:40	+dutchie	[17:40:24] and supperts uci or whatever it is
2018-09-21 18:45:40	someone235_	[17:47:06] artefact: How can you do it with cutechess?
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:00:33] I wish that quote were short enough for me to write on the whiteboard at chess club. It's long been one of my favorites.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:01:22] In fact I'm running out of quotes to use. I've seen plenty of lists of chess quotes but few are suitable for the whiteboard.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	artefact	[18:02:15] just write “rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1 White to play and win”
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:02:38] They have to be short and either witty or useful.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:02:50] Useful to a casual player, that is.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:07:15] haha holy shit
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:07:34] so, the official calendar of the national team champs isn't out yet
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:08:13] but I managed to coax the pairings for the first round out of it
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:08:26] I'm playing a kid I thought to play chess 20 years ago!
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:13:34] last game in the DB is from 2005, meh
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:13:37] Very nice
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:15:16] To hell with it. I might use that Discworld quote anyway.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:16:03] Our club *is* in a library. A literary quote is appropriate
2018-09-21 18:45:40	furrykef	[18:16:37] I think I'll save it for when we start getting a lot of people again... which probably won't be until next summer.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	oddskill	[18:20:11] hello ##chess
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:20:21] hmm, URS calculates ratings for all FIDE rated players
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:22:31] wtf they even have one for me
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:22:40] I don't have a FIDE even
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:23:03] It's a nice one too.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:23:06] I approve of URS.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:42:02] Blitz Gap = the Universal Rating advantage the player would need for a 50% expected score in blitz (Game in 5 minutes each) against an opponent whose quality and consistency of play do not worsen at quicker time controls.
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:42:29] Magnus Blitz gap = 32 Elo
2018-09-21 18:45:40	Garf	[18:42:45] so, are they claiming that if you gave magnus only 5 minutes, he'd only lose 32 Elo?

2018-09-21 19:05:50	furrykef	I want to create a game brand called Zen Garden Games but I'm worried this use of the term "Zen" is cultural appropriation. I'm surprised by how many times I've voiced this concern and have been told "cultural appropriation is not a thing"
2018-09-21 19:06:22	furrykef	(also, from a business perspective, it doesn't matter whether it's a thing or not; if your name is gonna offend some of your target audience, it's not a good name)
2018-09-21 19:06:44	furrykef	I'm currently pondering the name Rock Garden Games but it doesn't have quite the same zing
2018-09-21 19:09:09	flapz	first think of kickass ideas for games, and implement, THEN pick a name

2018-09-21 19:19:24	Garf	Blitz gap makes sense. 
2018-09-21 19:19:52	Garf	It's like how Stockfish Elo scales with hardware / thinking time / nodes searched 
2018-09-21 19:20:00	artefact	just sounds like an offset that gives your blitz rating
2018-09-21 19:20:07	artefact	conceptually no different than having two ratings

2018-09-21 19:34:04	furrykef	Well it kinda made sense... like 6 + 10 is 16, not 14

2018-09-22 16:35:29	eyeoh	[11:33:39] Fischer making chess popular for English-speaking countries probably helped push the belief https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/19/chess.sport

2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[13:07:25] hello
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[13:07:41] i've never played a gambit before
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[13:07:46] can someone teach me one :D
2018-09-22 16:35:29	artefact	[13:07:59] you've never blundered a pawn?
2018-09-22 16:35:29	artefact	[13:08:06] if it's in the first 10 moves, just say it's a gambit
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[13:08:36] i've never succeeded from losing a piece, the people i play usually can think further ahead than me
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[13:08:43] so never intentionally played one
2018-09-22 16:35:29	eyeoh	[13:12:40] what ratings are we talking about
2018-09-22 16:35:29	eyeoh	[13:12:44] for context
2018-09-22 16:35:29	furrykef	[13:21:22] The safest gambit is the Queen's Gambit
2018-09-22 16:35:29	furrykef	[13:21:38] You should be able to regain the gambit pawn easily enough
2018-09-22 16:35:29	artefact	[13:25:24] arguably that's not a “real” gambit
2018-09-22 16:35:29	eyeoh	[13:28:46] well then 'real' gambits are technically sacrifices
2018-09-22 16:35:29	furrykef	[13:30:16] They are, yes
2018-09-22 16:35:29	mursu	[13:56:08] Queen's gambit is the bomb
2018-09-22 16:35:29	mursu	[13:56:20] it's my favourite opening
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[15:16:19] i have to allow a specific sequence for that though
2018-09-22 16:35:29	prsstnt	[15:16:33] is there not some ingame gambits which you can do whatever the opening?
2018-09-22 16:35:29	penthief	[16:20:57] well since you can't play your opponents move, they don't have to accept

2018-09-23 17:42:25	furrykef	[07:41:54] Woo. Seems safe to say I've mastered high-school level trig
2018-09-23 17:42:25	furrykef	[07:45:56] I think I'm ready to study calculus. Or I could do statistics, or physics. So much juicy stuff to choose from
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[07:49:48] I find physics the most tempting.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[08:35:14] Where are you ultimately heading with all this maths?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[08:36:14] furrykef, start with calculus
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[08:51:22] calcalcalcalcalculus
2018-09-23 17:42:26	cacheyourdreams	[08:56:49] nananananana calculus!
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:05:59] :)
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:06:05] why?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:06:11] you are starting the new work tomorrow cacheyourdreams ?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:06:12] (I won't need calculus for this level of physics)
2018-09-23 17:42:26	cacheyourdreams	[09:06:22] that's right, qed
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:06:34] eyeoh: not really anywhere in particular. I'm just aiming to become mathematically literate.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:06:44] To not have to run away every time I see a page with a bunch of math on it.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:06:51] furrykef, believe me , calculus will open many doors for you
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:07:08] cacheyourdreams, I wish you much luck, may tomorrow be a good day
2018-09-23 17:42:26	cacheyourdreams	[09:07:13] thanks :)
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:08:32] Well we're only talking of a difference of at most a few weeks here. It's not like I'd be putting off calculus for years.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:09:53] well this is true of course furrykef , somehow my impression was that you will appericiate the physics module better after the calculus section
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:10:02] Linear Algebra is arguably as useful as calculus. 
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:10:22] flapz, it's very useful yes I agree
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:10:53] well of course at some levels calculus gets combined with linear algebra
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:11:01] and of course they blend together in vector calculus
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:11:09] yes
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:11:09] I don't think Khan Academy goes into linear algebra much unless it's in one of the calculus courses
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:11:36] I did some stuff with vectors and matrices in pre-calc, but it was all basic stuff
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:11:38] MIT open courseware, Gilbert Strang is excellent
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:11:57] I keep telling you guys, I've got enough on my plate right now
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:12:05] lol
2018-09-23 17:42:26	 *	qed [09:12:44] shoves three thousand page books on linear algebra onto furrykef's desk
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:13:09] :|
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:13:45] Incidentally I had to do a bit of math on Quora earlier today
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:13:47] Serge Lange. Check him out. Dude's a beast
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:15:08] The question was the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, and I calculated that even if the probability of life being present on any given star is as low as 10^-20, the probability of at least one of them having life would still be 99.995%
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:15:35] This is the post: https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-proof-or-evidence-of-alien-extraterrestrial-life-existence/answer/Kef-Schecter
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:16:08] I did get into a semantics argument in the comments over whether this constitutes "evidence" of extraterrestrial life... I think it does, in a loose sense of the term.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:18:06] flapz, I have the lang book at home
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:18:24] qed: Ah, the Algebra book? The tome
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:18:28] yes
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:18:45] maybe a bit heavy for furrykef 
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:19:00] well you I think it weights a kilo
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:19:01] he might have to buy an espresso machine 
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:19:03] *well yes
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:19:23] qed, does my math in the post look OK?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:20:18] furrykef, looks quite good yes
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:21:00] Thanks
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:21:25] but Serge wrote like a billion other books on all of math. He's a bit like Lev Landau is for physics
2018-09-23 17:42:26	flapz	[09:22:57] Lang was also a staunch socialist :) 
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:23:24] Y'know, if we ever find out there was life on Mars, that would be simultaneously exciting and depressing.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:23:31] Exciting for obvious reasons. Depressing 'cause it's all gone.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:25:37] not sure how much time life on earth will last
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:26:52] The big question is whether humanity will be able to go elsewhere instead of dying out.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:27:28] These options are of course not mutually exclusive... we would be just as capable of blowing each other up on another planet as on our own.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:30:45] Speaking of which.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:31:24] I've got this simulation I'm designing under the working title of "My World". If I get it made, it will be my magnum opus.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:31:36] It's basically a huge economic and political simulation.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:31:47] (Probably more economic than political.)
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:32:48] I'm thinking of setting it on another planet, like if humanity tried to colonize it but for some reason only a very few people made it to the planet's surface.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:33:15] A Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri sort of setting, but on a more earth-like planet.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:36:28] *happy equinox everybody
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:37:28] The Latinist in me is compelled to point out "equinox" means "equal night".
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:38:37] Bit of a misnomer really
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:38:48] Which reminds me, linguistics is part of my simulation, too, albeit probably a very small part of it. Linguistic change will be modeled, which means populations that are geographically separated will diverge linguistically over time.
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:38:56] Why so?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:38:57] Rh
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:39:00] Eh
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:39:10] Night doesn't happen until twilight is gone
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:39:38] (by "diverge linguistically" read "become increasingly unable to communicate")
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:40:31] explain bouba vs
2018-09-23 17:42:26	eyeoh	[09:40:38] and mum
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:41:57] You mean bouba and kiki?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	furrykef	[09:42:19] I don't think there's much to it. "K" is a harsher sound than anything in "bouba".
2018-09-23 17:42:26	qed	[09:43:54] eyeoh, did you have another nick in our channel or you are a newcomer?
2018-09-23 17:42:26	 *	qed [09:44:05] has a very poor memory
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:45:03] I think onomatopoeia were among the first words we used, so it makes sense that our brains are wired to correlate sound with other concepts in some way.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	eyeoh	[09:45:54] yeah
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[09:46:09] A man walks into a doctor’s office. He describes his symptoms to the doctor, and the doctor decides to run some blood tests on him to figure out the problem. After the test results come back, the doctor approaches the man and says, “Sir, I’m sorry, but you’re suffering from a severe case of Onomatopoeia.” The man, looking frightened, replies, “Onomatopoeia…what is that?” The Doctor replies, “It’s just what it sounds like.”
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:46:25] ba dum tss
2018-09-23 17:42:27	eyeoh	[09:46:25] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba%2Fkiki_effect?wprov=sfla1
2018-09-23 17:42:27	eyeoh	[09:46:41] heh
2018-09-23 17:42:27	eyeoh	[09:46:56] Piano time
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:46:59] I also suspect we developed sign language before we developed speech. As speech became more and more sophisticated, we used fewer and fewer signs until they seemed superfluous.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[09:47:27] furrykef, sign language before speech theory is pretty much the consensus I think
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:47:29] The reason I suspect this is because humans can handle sign language just as well as they can handle speech.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[09:47:37] because apes and babies use signs
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:47:40] yeah, I'm not surprised.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[09:50:29] furrykef: i havent done much math since high school. You recommend khan?
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:50:37] Yeah, it's pretty good.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:51:05] I still have yet to do math beyond high school level, though.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[09:57:01] maybe qed can help with this.. is there info anywhere that describes real world usage of math? Where and when would you use trigonometry ? Calculus? 
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:57:55] IMO physics is the best place to look for how math relates to the real world.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:58:46] Trig is used all the time in game programming.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[09:59:52] Khan Academy's trig course has a variety of word problems, some of which have potential to be relevant in the real world.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[09:59:53] emajor, I think that one surprising fact is that you can use trigonometry to prove that sum_{n=1}^infinity 1/n^2 = pi^2/6
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:00:15] Wish I could say the same for their Algebra 2 and Pre-calc courses, but they're mostly pure math.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:00:42] qed, I think he's looking for practical applications :P
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:00:50] haha yes! :D
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:02:22] I do not know anything practical
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:02:46] we are getting philosophical now
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:02:47] mainly due to the fact that I do not have a practical frame of mind
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:03:17] amusingly enough my degree is applied math and computer science
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:03:47] emajor, in math usually differential equations are used to model practical stuff
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:03:59] so that's a very important topic of course
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:04:08] ODEs and PDEs
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:04:16] I have nothing against math for the sake of math, but we developed math to solve real-world problems, and I think we shouldn't lose sight of that.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:04:24] Sadly, we do all too often when we try teaching math.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:04:45] its one problem i had during high school. learning geometry and doing graphs.. i had no idea WHY we were doing it.. and how it would be used in real world
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:04:58] it was fun tho
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:05:01] haha
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:05:15] I had a big epiphany the other day when I finally understood that imaginary numbers describe rotations on the complex plane.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:05:30] oh that's a beautiful topic furrykef 
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:05:38] Want to rotate by 90 degrees? Multiply by i. Want to rotate by 45 degrees? Multiply by i^(1/2).
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:06:12] there is a famous book called visual complex analysis who explains this stuff nicely
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:06:28] When I learned imaginary numbers in high school, I was taught i = sqrt(-1) and therefore i^2 = -1, and little else on the subject.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:06:35] While those things are true, they miss the point by a mile.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:06:37] maybe you might like to take a look to amuse yourself furrykef 
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:07:00] Enough. On. Plate. Already. :P
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:07:10] :)
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:07:21] you guys seen the movie Pi? (1998)
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:07:27] I have not emajor 
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:07:30] Hopefully in a few weeks I'll be done with all this stuff, but it'll be time to get back to work on Virtual Chess Coach.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:07:34] I have not.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:07:40] i recommend it
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:07:41] any movie about Pi must be a bit... irrational
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:07:45] ba dum tss
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:07:56] "A paranoid mathematician searches for a key number that will unlock the universal patterns found in nature."
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:08:01] :D
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:08:08] e.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:08:09] Done.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:08:29] emajor, a 90 year old mathematician will present a solution of one of the most famous open questions in math tomorrow
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:08:42] he claims to have proven the Riemann Hypothesis
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:08:55] math world says: lol no, must be a mistake in the proof
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:09:27] I'm skeptical myself, if only because there are so many cranks out there.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	emajor	[10:09:27] number porn
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:09:35] he was one of the most brilliant mathematicians in the world when he was 40, but now he is 90
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:09:49] The other day I came across a guy who insists pi = 4.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:10:01] I think that in the bible pi=3
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:10:51] The Bible implies pi is 3 but it doesn't claim the numbers are exact.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:14:58] so much nonsense in the bible, they could have devoted a few pages to an accurate calculation of pi instead :p
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:15:08] :P
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:15:39] you know I had bible studies each year as a school boy
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:15:55] I liked it, it was like history lessons
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:16:28] because I studied in a secular school so they do not claim that everything is as it is written , instead we discuss it from a historical pov
2018-09-23 17:42:27	furrykef	[10:16:35] As an atheist, I regard the Bible to be similar to, say, the Odyssey, only much more boring.
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:19:01] oh yes 
2018-09-23 17:42:27	qed	[10:19:10] lord of the rings is a way better book than the bible
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[10:19:43] all this ultra orthodox guys are just people in a book club that are stuck on the same book for 3000 years
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[10:29:13] The other day I posted on Quora that I haven't been given any particular reason to believe there is a god. Somebody responded with one word: "Jesus." Somehow I remain unconvinced.
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[10:31:41] Jesus Christ Almighty
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[10:35:34] I downloaded lichess on my phone
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:45:23] beeman: Note that the puzzle graph seems buggy
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:45:54] furrykef: Don't visit quora - it's not worth it
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:47:16] Also regarding maths, I get the feeling many are just doing it for a confidence boost
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[10:47:46] Looks good
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:47:56] It's a reddit FAQ
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:48:07] (maths)
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[10:48:21] I want to learn soldering and electronics instead
2018-09-23 17:42:28	penthief	[11:32:12] Yeah, about that buggy puzzle graph on lichess mobile, it is a strange one. It seemed the mobile app is serving up puzzles i had completed on desktop, but maybe not always. It also seems one those old puzzles were cleared out, the ratings would start being recorded again. There is an offline feature where 50 puzzles are cached, which may be related. I mentioned it here, and somebody suggested it may just be the mobile in the android app store that
2018-09-23 17:42:28	penthief	[11:32:12]  has the issue.
2018-09-23 17:42:28	penthief	[11:32:38] once* those old puzzles...
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[11:46:02] eyeoh: I like Quora.
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[11:51:28] Quora is not very good
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[11:51:43] it's full of creative writing exercises with few real useful bits of info
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[11:52:21] penthief: nuking the cached and stored data seems to fix it, but it's a hassle to do that
2018-09-23 17:42:28	penthief	[11:52:34] oh,ok
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[11:52:59] beeman: have you checked out all the different features, including clock and OTB?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[11:53:10] no other chess app has ever been so complete
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[11:57:55] Who said anything about useful?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[12:09:45] @eyeoh: no
2018-09-23 17:42:28	emajor	[12:47:40] stalemate makes me want to cry
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[12:51:01] yes chess should probably be redesigned to prevent stalemates
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[13:00:44] Play Chinese Chess, then. You win if you stalemate your opponent.
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[13:10:18] furrykef, you know how aussies call a guy who haven't bathed in months... a stale mate
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[13:10:52] groan
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[13:16:59] Been doing review of old material to make sure I've got it all down. My mastery level of Algebra 1 is now 98%
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[13:17:42] you should read the gormenghast novels furrykef 
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[13:17:49] the hero there is called Titus Groan
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[13:40:12] stalemate is a win for the one who forces it
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[13:49:38] in what sense can a stalemate be forced?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	artefact	[13:51:26] the obvious one?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[13:52:29] I imagine forcing stalemate is rare in western chess, but it can be done
2018-09-23 17:42:28	artefact	[13:53:28] https://artefact2.gitlab.io/ormulogun/#puzzle-alpha2-2413
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[13:57:05] so you think white won by forcing the stalemate with that move?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[13:57:46] wait no cause that was his only choice :D
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[14:38:19] well, you can force a stalemate against a weaker player who has somehow got ahead of you (perhaps if you blundered)
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[14:38:35] making them snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[14:39:02] otherwise if you're good, why are you concerned about stalemates at all?
2018-09-23 17:42:28	furrykef	[14:39:15] More typically you'd force some kind of draw that isn't a stalemate, like taking the opposition in a king and pawn endgame
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[14:44:28] i suck at chess
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[14:44:37] i should focus on acquiring a stalemate
2018-09-23 17:42:28	prsstnt	[14:44:49] (when i play at chess club especially)
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[15:03:42] furrykef, I won in a queen against rook endgame
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[15:03:50] t'was tricky
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[15:25:40] at my level, stalemate is definitely a type of blunder
2018-09-23 17:42:28	eyeoh	[15:26:10] for the opponent when they're ahead, and you're about to be mated, but escape
2018-09-23 17:42:28	qed	[15:32:09] thanks for watching bosspotato 
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[15:42:02] artefact: nice did you make it? i wonder why those are good moves
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[15:42:31] prsstnt: me too
2018-09-23 17:42:28	+beeman	[15:44:41] what consider a good move if in the end i lose?

2018-09-24 11:22:19	furrykef	What a silly question.
2018-09-24 11:22:41	furrykef	The alternative would be the players occasionally being forced to repeat a position until one player's clock runs out.
2018-09-24 11:22:59	furrykef	(which possibly won't even happen if there's an increment)
2018-09-24 11:25:09	+tobiasvl	and don't people remember the threefold repetition Karjakin claimed against Eljanov in the 2016 world cup rapids playoff?
2018-09-24 11:25:40	furrykef	You're assuming that all players care about stuff like that. The only reason I even know the name Karjakin is because people in this channel won't shut up about people like him.
2018-09-24 11:25:48	+tobiasvl	haha. okay.
2018-09-24 11:26:44	+tobiasvl	anyway, it was a very high-profile rapid game which ended in a threefold repetition, so it clearly applies
2018-09-24 11:26:47	furrykef	(I have absolutely zero interest in chess personalities, including Magnus Carlsen, beyond what they can teach me about the game)
2018-09-24 11:28:11	+Jik	tobiasvl: the moves of that game were probably recorded by an arbiter though
2018-09-24 11:28:45	+tobiasvl	that's true
2018-09-24 11:39:21	furrykef	well, OK, with a slight exception for Garry Kasparov, 'cause he's an interesting guy. But most of what interests me about him isn't his chess.

2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:31:28] furrykef: this happened in my game in the national blitz champs this weekend
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:31:48] The threefold thing?
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:31:54] also, this not being a fide world champs, we had 3 arbiters for 150 people
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:32:24] yes, I tried to claim a threefold with 25s left vs about 40s for my opponent
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:33:35] But as you can read, it's not really possible to do so in the regular way. You basically have to ask the arbiter to judge.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:34:35] tobiasvl: video/story of the incident? thought that would be using Competition Rules, which we weren't
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:35:15] Hey, qed: https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:35:32] when my opponent played on after my claim, I repeated a few more times, sighed that it was a 5-fold by now, and was about to stop the clock when the opponent said they agreed to a draw
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:36:39] moral of almost all such disputes is "stop the clock and call arbiter" anyway
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:37:08] I saw one player play on with his opponents queen when he couldn't find his own after a promotion
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:37:25] ...wat.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:37:32] Did not seem like a very rational decision to me.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:37:34] I would be like "oh HELL no"
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:38:53] Correct behavior would've been to claim an illegal move btw.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:39:13] Indeed
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:39:14] (And stop the clock if you can't find the right piece)
2018-09-24 14:27:05	xcombelle	[12:40:15] I'm pretty proud of this game I won as black https://lichess.org/GX3k2Igr/black
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:41:42] Something else funny: the new FIDE blitz rules saved me a point.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:41:55] I had an unrated opponent play Bb4 (without me playing Nc3!)
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:42:01] And I responded d3. :P
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:42:34] Would've been instant loss under old rules, now it was just a time penalty.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:43:45] I kinda dislike blitz (or rapid) without increment, but playing a full tournament in an afternoon is handy.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:44:23] I dislike any chess without increment
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:44:47] Unless the clock starts out very high, like an hour
2018-09-24 14:27:05	Aeres	[12:44:52] i dont even know how to play chess :D
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:45:02] well, without increment it has to be >1h to not be rapid :)
2018-09-24 14:27:05	mursu	[12:45:04] who really does
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:45:24] horsies go L shaped
2018-09-24 14:27:05	Aeres	[12:45:32] mursu you know how to play chess?
2018-09-24 14:27:05	mursu	[12:45:39] Badly :DD
2018-09-24 14:27:05	Aeres	[12:45:48] WHOOOOOAAA Garf nice one (notes down, horsie goes L)
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:46:02] It goes jumpy jumpy, too
2018-09-24 14:27:05	Aeres	[12:46:04] mursu yaaay! two bad players among two great players hebeh
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:51:45] wait, did you just call me a great player?
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:54:37] I know even of a secret rule.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:54:40] It's called en pissant.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:55:16] I wonder how many of my chess club's regulars even know en passant.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:55:56] I hate en passant, BTW. I think we should disallow two-square pawn moves.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:56:07] That rule dates from a time before chess clocks.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:56:56] Obviously, the fundamental rules of chess are never gonna change. But if I were to make one change, it would be that.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:58:41] I like lichess's current puzzle of the day: https://lichess.org/training/75316
2018-09-24 14:27:05	furrykef	[12:58:47] I solved it in a few seconds, but it's beautiful nonetheless.
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:59:57] woodpecker method is supposed to be on chessable today
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Jik	[12:59:58] https://twitter.com/ChessMike/status/1044191674631684096/photo/1
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[12:59:59] instant buy for me
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Jik	[13:00:11] What's going on there? A huge boycott?
2018-09-24 14:27:05	+Garf	[13:00:14] the chess pattern recognizition book is a bit meh
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Garf	[13:00:34] I mean, those extra moves are sometimes very hard and not directly related to the point
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Garf	[13:01:04] Jik: interesting. 
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:04:59] $24.99 is a lot to ask...
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Garf	[13:06:44] same as on forwardches
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:11:36] furrykef, In his rebuttal, Mochizuki attributes Scholze and Stix’s criticism to “certain fundamental misunderstandings” about his work. Their “negative position,” he wrote, “does not imply the existence of any flaws whatsoever” in his theory.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:11:42] furrykef, lolies
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:11:47] qed :D
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:12:01] I should definitely write it to a referee who will reject a paper of mine
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:12:06] hi hi Aeres 
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:12:12] Aeres, how have you been my friend?
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[13:12:22] commas save lives
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:12:43] qed Bad as usual :D , I just checked my competition results. My team's name is not in there hehe
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:12:54] I lost.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[13:12:55] that sounds like "remind me, how did you become my friend?"
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:13:12] Jik lol! :3
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:14:28] lol
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:14:52] there will be many more competitions
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:15:17] life is a series of failures after all, the key is to keep on trying no matter how many times we fail
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:15:24] a hell lot of competitions to loose indeed hehehe :p
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:15:43] qed yes, you are indeed correct.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[13:16:10] Ok, chess24 says USA made their first moves after around 6-7 min
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:18:21] go USA!
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:18:47] go USA!!(notice the second exclamation marks :3)
2018-09-24 14:27:06	mursu	[13:20:08] go USA??
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:20:44] wow another one with question marks. time to save lives with comma. go USA,,
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:21:59] mursu, chess olympiad started today
2018-09-24 14:27:06	mursu	[13:22:27] chess isn't a real sport >:(
2018-09-24 14:27:06	mursu	[13:22:41] not enough sweaty men
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:24:22] some chess players must visit the bathroom every 5 minutes from stress, if you do not call that a physical effort I can not argue with you anymore
2018-09-24 14:27:06	mursu	[13:24:43] I dunno man
2018-09-24 14:27:06	mursu	[13:24:49] depends how out of shape the player is
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:25:11] several years ago magnus was crushing players due to his physical shape
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:25:15] qed thats hilarious :3 I just realise how low my stamina in chess is
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:25:16] everyone been saying it then
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:25:40] he was getting the opponents into 7 hour games
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:25:50] in the 7th hour they could not think anymore
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:25:57] magnus on the other hand was fresh and dandy
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Aeres	[13:26:24] whoooooooaaaa (my head stops working every 30mins or so ig)
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[13:26:47] any interesting courses next semester Aeres ?
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:28:08] qed: I've started on KA's AP Physics 1 course
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:28:59] I'm a little annoyed that this course doesn't have quizzes... normally courses have exercises, quizzes, unit tests, and the course challenge, in increasing order of material covered
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:29:19] I like quizzes because it allows me to skip exercises for material I already know
2018-09-24 14:27:06	Momentum	quit
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:39:52] I'm pretty good at grasping concepts, at least when there's a clear relation to familiar ideas... it asked me to find the instantaneous speed at a certain point of the graph of the position of an object, and I immediately understood that it wanted the slope of the line
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:41:03] (If the graph had been curved then I would take the derivative, right?)
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:44:30] Or actually it's the derivative either way, since the derivatve of a line is its slope.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:50:01] Now it wants a displacement delta x for a similar graph. I didn't know what it was talking about, but it wants the area under the line over the interval... which is the integral, right?
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[13:50:06] So technically I'm already doing calculus :P
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+JimmyRustles	[14:16:39] how many points is worth to remove your opponent's ability to castle?
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:17:03] Depends entirely on the position, I imagine
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:17:58] For example castling likely won't help your opponent much if his pawn structure is ragged on both sides
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:18:04] furrykef: I find it interesting that you first think of a slope or area, and only then derivative or integral.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:18:25] Jik: I haven't studied calculus, though I'm familiar with a few of the very basic concepts
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:18:54] Most of the students learning this material won't even know what a derivative or integral is
2018-09-24 14:27:06	qed	[14:19:07] heresy
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:19:22] Which is probably why they're not mentioned by name... they're scary terms :P
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:19:46] (Maybe they're mentioned in the lectures, but I only consult them when I don't understand the exercises)
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:20:24] Derivative of speed is the rate of change of speed, which is acceleration; it's only coincidental that it's the slope! Similarly, integration of speed is the sum of all small changes caused by speed, which is the integral; it's only coincidental that it's the area! But of course it's easier to first teach the graphical interpretation of these things before starting to name names or go through ...
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:20:30] ...definitions, so your way if thinking is indeed very natural.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:20:53] Anyway, back to chess... assuming your opponent would benefit from castling, how much it's worth to prevent it depends on how much of an attack you can build against the uncastled king.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:20:55] And I have no idea what I had in mind when I wrote "integration of speed is the sum of all small changes caused by speed, which is the integral".
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:21:33] Often if you want to prevent your opponent from castling when you're attacking, the points system goes out of the window anyway.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:21:34] I wouldn't call them coincidences
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:22:44] , unless the point of attacking is to force your opponent to defend so that they have lost material when the attack ends, in which case losing castling rights isn't really important anymore.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:23:47] Obviously you can attach some statistical average point value for not being able to castle, but the average is not very useful as the actual value depends a lot on the position. 
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:24:36] Hmm, now I'm interested in seeing how Stockfish would score against itself in the starting position where either player's castling rights were removed.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:24:54] I know that in certain lines of the Caro-Kann black can wind up with a wide open queenside and no castling rights if he's not careful. That's a terrible position to be in.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:24:59] rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w kq - 0 1
2018-09-24 14:27:06	furrykef	[14:25:20] That's one reason I stopped playing the Caro. Too tricky for me right now.
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:26:30] The reason I've never started Caro is that there's too many things White could do to give entirely different positions, and I don't want to learn them all. Plus I like Panov-Botvinnik for White so I must hate it for Black, right?
2018-09-24 14:27:06	+Jik	[14:26:42] But then again, I don't know any good openings for black after 1.e4, so...

2018-09-24 14:33:26	+Jik	Well she's Mamedyarov's sister, it's only natural that her name is Mamedyarov-a.
2018-09-24 14:33:48	+Garf	is she? aha!
2018-09-24 14:34:02	+Momentum	the a makes a lot of sense
2018-09-24 14:34:19	furrykef	Yeah, that's how Slavic names work. The surname becomes feminine for women
2018-09-24 14:34:34	furrykef	So Garry Kasparov's wife would be Kasparova

2018-09-24 14:40:52	+Jik	i think i recall there was some drama behind it at some point
2018-09-24 14:41:05	+Jik	and by drama i mean some people were upset that he doesn't play
2018-09-24 14:41:29	+Jik	Is he Carlsen's second again, that might explain?

2018-09-25 12:28:58	+furrykef	[06:26:19] I'm taking it slowly. It's not hard at all so far, but I've still gotta catch up on my chess studies and stuff.

2018-09-25 12:28:58	qed-office	[06:26:54] I have started drinking much coffee

2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[08:19:12] I'm a little annoyed that this course is getting into the basic kinematic equations but doesn't explain where the equations come from
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[08:19:25] I loathe rote memorization. You should understand first, *then* memorize

2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[09:33:57] I had v_0^2 where I should have had v_0*t but they both were 0 anyway
2018-09-25 12:28:59	emajor	[09:49:52] qed-office: so what happened for it to not go well with this 90 year old? did he stumble across a mistake or did someone yell out? haha
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[09:54:57] it's complete nonsense from what I hear
2018-09-25 12:28:59	emajor	[10:06:45] qed-office: id love to see his face when it all comes crumbling down
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[10:08:36] "complete nonsense" sounds like it's overstating it, but maybe that's just 'cause I don't know enough math to know how kooky it is
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[10:09:58] I notice at least two of the kinematic formulas are calculus problems in disguise

2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[10:50:18] On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife were killed in a vehicle accident on the New Jersey Turnpike near Monroe Township, New Jersey. They had been on their way home from the airport after a visit to Norway, where Nash had received the Abel Prize
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[10:50:54] CuriousErnestBro: unfortunately I doubt there would be much point in us playing
2018-09-25 12:28:59	CuriousErnestBro	[10:51:25] You're probably right
2018-09-25 12:28:59	CuriousErnestBro	[10:51:39] I got my ass handed to me by weaklings around 1800 elo
2018-09-25 12:28:59	CuriousErnestBro	[10:51:44] It wasn't even funny
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[10:56:15] CuriousErnestBro: that's pretty cool!
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:00:42] my opponent just lost the exchange
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:00:50] now he's just running down his clock without making a move
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:00:52] i hate when people do that
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:00:59] Yyyep.
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:01:33] only idiots do that
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:01:42] No shortage of idiots.
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:04:39] damn
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:04:40] he made a move
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:04:42] and ended up winning
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:04:47] now i wish he'd have just timed out
2018-09-25 12:28:59	mursu	[11:04:56] so it was just deep think?
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:05:00] maybe
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:05:34] it takes time to fire up the engine :p
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:05:45] good morning JimmyRustles 
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:05:56] good morning qed
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:06:13] JimmyRustles: how is your day so far my friend?
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:06:45] not bad
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:06:50] i just woke up and had a joint
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:07:40] very nice!
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:07:59] I got up at 6am took a train and now stressing over some inequalities
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:15:01] lol awesome
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:15:06] i just made a great comeback
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:15:11] was down a bishop but found a mate in one
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:15:12] https://i.imgur.com/AJZrG13.png
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:26:59] whew. Think I've finally got a good handle on the basic kinematic formulas.
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:28:07] is there a computer program where you can enter a chess position and it tells you if it's a valid position (reachable from the starting position with legal moves)?
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+JimmyRustles	[11:28:15] i can't imagine it'd be easy to write a program to do that
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:29:12] Technically it's trivial to write one but it may take a very, very long time to run if it's not programmed well :P
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:29:24] Whether there's one viable for everyday use, I don't know.
2018-09-25 12:28:59	 *	furrykef [11:55:28] frowns
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:55:45] This exercise seems to want me to solve a kinematic problem with only two known constants
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:55:58] There must be a third one implied somewhere...
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:56:10] (It's not gravity. That's one of the two.)
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[11:58:07] Aha! The object ends in the same position it started, meaning its displacement is 0.
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:59:08] JimmyRustles: not sure if it is a trivial task
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:59:12] might be quite difficult
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[11:59:20] lots of pieces, lots of movement rules
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[11:59:34] JimmyRustles: not possible in the general case
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:00:08] There are lots of problems that are not easily solvable in the general case but are easily solved with reasonable cases, though
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[12:00:30] well, for reasonable cases as in, ending position happened in an existing game, it's trivial with scid
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[12:00:41] but the underlying problem is known as "proof games"
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[12:00:45] it's relevant for problem composers
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+Garf	[12:00:57] where making a problem that can't actually happen in a game is considered bad form
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:01:55] A lot of positions can be identified as legal or illegal with just the human eye. Of course, then you probably wouldn't need to put it into a program...
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:03:23] Granted, it's easier to prove illegality than legality. With an illegal position you can just say something like "white has a bishop on e4 but none of his pawns moved", or "black has 8 pawns and 3 knights"
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[12:04:46] if one has only a knight on the board proving a path from one square to another is alread requires you to build a graph and search for a path in it
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:04:52] To prove legality you must either prove that there are no illegalities or you must actually construct the position from the starting position (I suspect this is the approach such a program would take)
2018-09-25 12:28:59	ua	[12:05:19] JimmyRustles, https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/1482/how-to-know-when-a-fen-position-is-legal lol
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[12:06:49] ua that works only in 99.99% of the position or so says the author
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:06:56] Of course the problem becomes harder if the 50 move rule is in effect
2018-09-25 12:28:59	qed-office	[12:07:15] ua but thanks for the link, it is a good heuristic
2018-09-25 12:28:59	mquin	[12:07:23] I'd guess you'd have to do both - apply heuristics to weed out illegal positions, then start working backwards
2018-09-25 12:28:59	+furrykef	[12:07:29] Hey Garf, did you try the woodpecker book yet? What do you think?
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:07:41] I already had it in PGN and I already thought it was awesome
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:07:48] I meant the Chessable version
2018-09-25 12:29:00	ua	[12:07:48] qed-office, yep 99.99% but you dont have to search for an actual path from starting position to the target one
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:07:59] it's also awesome
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:08:02] did ~250 so far
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:08:19] I mean i just use Chessable as cross-platform chess books with a board
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:08:28] you can't really do the method itself with Chessable but that's fine
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:08:45] Isn't it supposed to have a mode that lets you use the method?
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:09:59] "only if we sell 1000"
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:12:05] actually, I think you probably can
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:12:12] just ignore the review button until you complete the book
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:12:20] hmm, but then it'll give you the wrong ones faster
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:12:33] can probably just reset that after a cycle
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:15:52] oh
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:16:42] I think it may have been a mistake for them to announce the stretch goal. A lot of people will probably wait to see if it might be reached soon
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:17:27] It would be irrational to behave that way when you would have bought the book if no stretch goal had been announced... but people are irrational.
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:18:03] (I once read a lovely book about this sort of thing: Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely)
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:19:07] I hadn't finished 1001 excercises for beginners yet, but I can do that later, or never. It's served its purpose
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:20:20] Since only 229 people have signed up for it, I'm skeptical the goal will be reached.
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:20:31] well, 236 now
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+Garf	[12:22:01] I guess they might still add the feature later
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+eyeoh	[12:24:11] what stretch goals are we talking about?
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:26:01] The one for this: https://www.chessable.com/the-woodpecker-method/course/10582/
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:26:15] "if the course reaches 1,000 students in the first month, we promise to add yet another feature: custom spaced-repetition intervals (Stretch goal!)."
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+eyeoh	[12:26:57] > "The quick explanation of the Woodpecker Method is that you need to solve a large number of puzzles in a row; then solve the same puzzles again and again, only faster." oh gawd
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+eyeoh	[12:28:00] I don't understand why
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:28:13] Because so much of chess is pattern recognition
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+furrykef	[12:28:45] You really want to grasp the most common patterns right away
2018-09-25 12:29:00	+eyeoh	[12:28:54] Why pay though

2018-09-25 12:29:22	+eyeoh	so assume it improves rating by 25% - then what?
2018-09-25 12:29:43	+furrykef	What do you mean, then what?
2018-09-25 12:29:45	+eyeoh	hang on, I have an appropriate video for this:
2018-09-25 12:30:00	+eyeoh	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYfg6tQbkX4
2018-09-25 12:30:14	+furrykef	If you don't want to improve your rating then of course you won't buy the book
2018-09-25 12:30:30	+eyeoh	Why this book ahead of all the other classics?
2018-09-25 12:30:55	+eyeoh	also I think your statement isn't true
2018-09-25 12:31:04	+eyeoh	I want to improve my rating, but I'm not going to buy that book.
2018-09-25 12:31:19	+furrykef	My statement does not contradict your statement
2018-09-25 12:31:22	+eyeoh	The suggestion here is that I'm not going to improve if I don't buy that book - suspicious
2018-09-25 12:31:35	+furrykef	No, that is not what I said or even implied
2018-09-25 12:31:48	+furrykef	You asked, "so assume it improves rating by 25% - then what?"
2018-09-25 12:32:06	+eyeoh	ok I see
2018-09-25 12:32:11	+eyeoh	that statement seems a bit redundant though
2018-09-25 12:32:13	+furrykef	My point was if you're buying the book then you see improving your rating as an end goal
2018-09-25 12:32:25	+eyeoh	alright
2018-09-25 12:32:35	+eyeoh	so the question is, what does this book do that others don't do better?
2018-09-25 12:32:37	+furrykef	Of course it won't necessarily be the case that your rating will improve, and of course it can improve by other means
2018-09-25 12:33:02	+furrykef	Garf can answer that question better than I can. I haven't bought it and I'm not sure I'm going to.
2018-09-25 12:33:11	+eyeoh	by default I'm sceptical of anything on Kickstarter, only because of probability
2018-09-25 12:33:17	+furrykef	It's not a Kickstarter
2018-09-25 12:33:35	+eyeoh	s/Kickstarter/anything crowd funded
2018-09-25 12:33:47	+furrykef	And the product is already for sale. Just not a particular feature that it will get if it sells 1000 copies
2018-09-25 12:33:59	+eyeoh	'stretch goal' flagged it for me
2018-09-25 12:34:00	-->	tdy (~tdy@unaffiliated/tdy) has joined ##chess
2018-09-25 12:34:46	+eyeoh	suggests that the default deal is flawed
2018-09-25 12:34:53	+furrykef	I presume the product's primary value is it's over 1000 well chosen puzzles
2018-09-25 12:35:34	+furrykef	I can't vouch for whether or not it's better to use hand-picked puzzles over randomly chosen puzzles like at ChessTempo
2018-09-25 12:35:57	+furrykef	'Cause so far I've only done the latter option
2018-09-25 12:36:06	+eyeoh	yes I this is why I'm sceptical by default until it's demonstrated otherwise
2018-09-25 12:36:15	+eyeoh	I see so much marketing
2018-09-25 12:36:53	+eyeoh	that said, I did just drop A$154 on my *first* multimeter, and am about to drop another ~A$500 on a soldering station + accessories
2018-09-25 12:36:55	+furrykef	I'm guessing handpicked puzzles are more likely to focus on the most useful motifs, whereas randomly chosen puzzles are hit and miss in that regard
2018-09-25 12:37:03	+Garf	The book is a good selection of tactics of different levels.
2018-09-25 12:37:13	+eyeoh	Garf: is it unique?
2018-09-25 12:37:30	+Garf	Unique in what sense? It's the best one in that category that I have seen so far.
2018-09-25 12:38:10	+Garf	It's also amusing because it's all world champion games, and they're on the losing end, too.
2018-09-25 12:38:26	+Garf	"beat Alekhine in a simul by finding this tactic"

2018-09-25 12:39:18	+Garf	compared to lichess, some solutions have alternates
2018-09-25 12:39:29	mursu	$25 is not a bad price for a good tactics book imo
2018-09-25 12:39:32	+Garf	wouldn't be an advantage compared to chesstempo
2018-09-25 12:39:43	+eyeoh	unique to chesstempo, I guess
2018-09-25 12:39:48	+eyeoh	or other classic books you might know of
2018-09-25 12:40:16	+Garf	Most older classic books are busted. This one isn't so much.
2018-09-25 12:40:25	+eyeoh	What does busted mean?
2018-09-25 12:40:48	+Garf	Many other plagiarize each other (especially Polgars' work I see a lot). In this one at least it's clear where the games come from, and many are recent too.
2018-09-25 12:40:58	+Garf	eyeoh: the solution is wrong or there is an alt (books from weaker computer ages)
2018-09-25 12:41:32	+furrykef	Yeah, I have an old Reinfeld book that's full of errors like that
2018-09-25 12:41:55	+Garf	So, if you want a good tactics book without busts, with alts (that are marked) and from world champions' games instead of randomes, this is uniquely good.
2018-09-25 12:42:13	+furrykef	This is also a bit of a problem (though to a smaller extent) with old non-puzzle books
2018-09-25 12:42:15	+Garf	And I think that's a pretty good combo.
2018-09-25 12:42:24	+Garf	furrykef: yes, it is.
2018-09-25 12:42:41	+eyeoh	and how about compared to Chess Tempo then?
2018-09-25 12:42:47	+furrykef	I've read some of My System and a few of the things Nimzowitsch says are decidedly not consensus today
2018-09-25 12:43:05	+eyeoh	because CT is free, unlike a A$40 cheap soldering station, which is a contender against a A$160 soldering station.
2018-09-25 12:43:08	+Garf	I'd say there is a bit more variety of positions perhaps.
2018-09-25 12:43:32	+Garf	Also more structures from different openings.
2018-09-25 12:43:33	+furrykef	CT's SRS (spaced repetition system) feature isn't free, though, and I consider it important
2018-09-25 12:43:48	+Garf	I can't quantify it, but lichess puzzles (and to a lesser extent CT) all seem very similar.

2018-09-25 12:50:12	+furrykef	[12:44:50] I like using an SRS for tactics in order to train pattern recognition as opposed to calculation
2018-09-25 12:50:12	+Garf	[12:45:17] Woodpecker is SRS but using the whole set, so that'd work :P
2018-09-25 12:50:12	+furrykef	[12:45:21] But there is the pitfall that you sometimes recognize the puzzle due to irrelevant elements of the position (akin to overfitting in a neural net)
2018-09-25 12:50:12	+eyeoh	[12:45:26] CT's premium membership isn't too cheap; hmm.
2018-09-25 12:50:12	+furrykef	[12:45:46] I paid for CT mostly because I'd been using it so long I wanted to support its creator
2018-09-25 12:50:12	+furrykef	[12:47:06] I am hoping Virtual Chess Coach will make both the book and ChessTempo obsolete, though :P

2018-09-25 13:22:32	+eyeoh	But I want to learn electronics seriously because it's not too far off from my career goal (information technology, which is what I'm supposedly studying at uni at the moment)
2018-09-25 13:22:57	Aeres_Bnc	wow eyeoh hifi I am in sameboat
2018-09-25 13:23:14	Aeres_Bnc	I mean I am also studying IT and electro goes above my head
2018-09-25 13:23:20	+eyeoh	so that's why I'm about to drop another several hundred on a soldering station, fume extractor and other stuff; after A$154 the other night on a multimeter
2018-09-25 13:23:41	+eyeoh	I think electronics is a bit of a black art only because few people get to truly access it these days
2018-09-25 13:23:48	+eyeoh	they only know how to be end users
2018-09-25 13:23:49	Aeres_Bnc	:D yes yes 
2018-09-25 13:24:14	+eyeoh	I have gear that I know will break, and I want to eventaully know how to fix it myself rather than pay someone else whose job is to fix it
2018-09-25 13:24:30	+eyeoh	I want to leave open the possibility that *I* will be the one who gets paid to fix stuff
2018-09-25 13:24:57	+eyeoh	I also thought about studying physics at uni at some point, then realised there's no reason I can't do it as a hobby (through electronics)
2018-09-25 13:25:27	+eyeoh	YouTubers like eevblog, rossmanngroup, ave, cody'slab show what's possible as far as doing stuff goes

2018-09-25 13:46:11	+furrykef	As for electronics... a lot of that stuff is pretty simple
2018-09-25 13:46:24	+furrykef	Transistors are nothing more than electrically controlled switches
2018-09-25 13:48:07	Aeres_Bnc	if you increase the supply currents stops flowing :d

2018-09-25 13:59:35	+furrykef	Of all the KA courses I want to take, it's at the bottom of the list
2018-09-25 14:00:46	Aeres_Bnc	wow I have tonnes of pending udemy courses 
2018-09-25 14:00:52	Aeres_Bnc	I need to finish those too

2018-09-25 14:07:06	+tobiasvl	cool

2018-09-25 14:07:35	+tobiasvl	I don't do much math, but the last few days I've been trying to design an algorithm for deciding whether randomly generated levels in my game are solvable or not
2018-09-25 14:07:35	qed-office	information tech is a good job
2018-09-25 14:07:40	+eyeoh	so that's what I'm sticking with; enough chopping and changing
2018-09-25 14:07:52	+tobiasvl	pretty hard for me. have to find some heuristics since it's NP-complete
2018-09-25 14:08:23	qed-office	just prove that P=NP, one solution to most of the problem you will encounter during your whole career
2018-09-25 14:08:39	Aeres_Bnc	eyeoh: :D its a good field, true Engineer is too weird most of the time is lost in writing journals FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT REASON :( 
2018-09-25 14:08:56	+tobiasvl	qed-office: yeah, I definitely considered that route
2018-09-25 14:09:09	+eyeoh	I'm constantly reminded by semi-naysayers that an IT degree is useless
2018-09-25 14:09:32	+eyeoh	so I'll just do the electronics as a hobby while I finish the IT degree
2018-09-25 14:10:07	+eyeoh	as opposed to IT as a hobby and electronics as a degree..
2018-09-25 14:10:16	Aeres_Bnc	eyeoh: IT degree is useless to those who are not good at it or atleast are not working hard on it. I have seen people getting placed and not a very shabby job too 
2018-09-25 14:10:53	+eyeoh	that's heartening to read

2018-09-25 14:39:53	+furrykef	I think my peak Blitz at CT is around 1550
2018-09-25 14:40:08	+Momentum	1717 right now
2018-09-25 14:40:10	+furrykef	lichess's puzzle ratings are weird
2018-09-25 14:41:00	+Momentum	but i have a higher perf rating idk if perf rating is supposed to converge to real rating after lot of play?
2018-09-25 14:41:02	+furrykef	My lichess puzzle rating is around 2000. For Standard at CT I peaked at like 1728 or something.

2018-09-25 16:10:28	+Momentum	32 ... Qxg3 is mate
2018-09-25 16:12:14	+Momentum	or maybe not
2018-09-25 16:12:21	+Momentum	because he can take with the queen
2018-09-25 16:12:51	+eyeoh	yeah not quite but stockfish says I could have ground him out
2018-09-25 16:13:11	+Momentum	with Qxg3?
2018-09-25 16:13:50	+Momentum	i don't think Qxg3 is leading anywhere after Qxg3 so i'm just blind

2018-09-25 16:46:25	+eyeoh	stockfish vs stockfish at 32 ... would have apparently led to a 44 move game; but this one was 42 at most, so they caved a bit

2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[10:48:49] giri against caruana today
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:29:31] god damn
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:29:36] i'm getting really fucking sick of losing at chess
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:29:43] i get into a good position and then suddenly it's a mate against me
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:29:49] don't play the KG
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+Jik	[11:29:58] artefact: he said good position
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:30:28] i keep playing the latvian gambit and falling into the same mating trap
2018-09-26 12:40:37	mursu	[11:30:52] well don't fall in to it?
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:31:01] play something sounder
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:32:20] yesterday i had a guy force a draw against me when he was +12
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:32:26] good enough for me, i guess
2018-09-26 12:40:37	notzmv	[11:32:30] lol
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:44:23] if your opponent has a really bad pawn structure but everything else is equal, is it a good idea to trade down into an endgame?
2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[11:46:39] yes unless you trade his bad pawns ^_^
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:49:33] depends on your endgame skills
2018-09-26 12:40:37	mursu	[11:50:23] endgames are the best games
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:51:08] well it doesn't matter
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:51:11] because i blundered my queen
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:51:14] so i'm going to lose anyway
2018-09-26 12:40:37	notzmv	[11:51:58] lmao
2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[11:53:06] there should be an inapp paid service to buy another queen at any point of the game
2018-09-26 12:40:37	mursu	[11:53:41] there should be an inapp purchase where you just automatically win
2018-09-26 12:40:37	mursu	[11:54:09] it's dynamically priced so that the more you are losing the more it costs
2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[11:54:13] lol
2018-09-26 12:40:37	+JimmyRustles	[11:55:45] 1. e4 e5 2. f4 (cost of a win for white at this point is $10 million)
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:56:26] unless you are playing fischer. then it's $0.01
2018-09-26 12:40:37	mursu	[11:56:33] lol
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:56:54] i am referring to his 2-page paper where he claims to refute “by force” the KG
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:57:16] it's like solving the GRH in 2 pages.
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:58:03] maybe fischer is the fermat of chess.
2018-09-26 12:40:37	artefact	[11:58:24] ”wins by force, but the margin is too small for me to actually prove it”
2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[12:01:56] JimmyRustles, Did you hear about McDonald's trying to get into the high end steakhouse market?
2018-09-26 12:40:37	qed	[12:01:58] It was a Big Mcsteak..
2018-09-26 12:40:37	HarveyPwca	[12:08:15] Interesting… I had no idea 5 yr olds were up this early to crack yolks.

2018-09-26 21:51:20	+Momentum	i was so surprised that there were people playing chess who never used chess engines so they don't appreciate by how much they are losing after dropping their queen so they keep playing
2018-09-26 21:52:46	+Momentum	chess players who never used chess engine don't give a shit about numerical evaluation so they keep playing any losing position until they get mated

2018-09-26 22:00:23	dude12312414	it's annoying when you have an obvious forced mat sequence (like a K vs K&Q ending or something) but they take their sweet time between each move (like, I had someone who accumulated > 20 min left in the game, and they would play one move each 5 minutes or something)

2018-09-26 22:06:26	+JimmyRustles	that'd be awful lol
2018-09-26 22:06:53	+JimmyRustles	i had a game a while ago where i was losing and i traded down into a K+KBB endgame hoping he wouldn't be able to do the mate

2018-09-26 22:08:02	+JimmyRustles	the chess engine i wrote has a practice mode for it
2018-09-26 22:08:06	+JimmyRustles	:)
2018-09-26 22:08:19	+Momentum	is that like playing from position?
2018-09-26 22:08:32	+JimmyRustles	yeah it sets up a random position with two bishops

2018-09-27 12:24:04	+eyeoh	[06:05:19] Phew, I didn't run out of time https://lichess.org/XAWG7OCg
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:36:51] good morning chess fans
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:38:42] goodmumble
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:38:57] Thinking of switching from physics to calculus for now.
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:41:07] you do not like the physics module?
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:41:14] or have you finished it?
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:41:48] It's not that I don't like it, exactly. Just thinking it's not really relevant enough to my immediate needs
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:42:17] calculus will be more beneficial yes
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:46:56] Not sure what you're basing that on, but OK :P
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:47:23] calculus is the base of math
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:47:32] without calculus you can't do _anything_ in math
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:47:41] so of course it will be better for you than knowing physics
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:48:17] I do discrete math, but even I need lots and lots of calculus to glue to combinatorics together
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:48:29] *to glue the combinatorics
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:50:07] But I've been doing lots of stuff without calculus :P
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:51:07] well for 2000 years people managed to get along without calculus tis true, but it is also true that it limits what you can do a lot
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:51:23] so why set yourself such strict limits
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:59:10] I might just do both courses at the same time. Study whichever I feel like studying at the moment.
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:59:22] sure things
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:59:25] *sure thing
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[06:59:43] It better be a sure thing. It's my study time, not yours :P
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:59:48] after students do 6 courses together in a semester and still survive
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[06:59:55] *after all
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[07:00:15] I remember doing that, the only problem was that I slept less than 6 hours
2018-09-27 12:24:04	+furrykef	[07:00:50] Well thankfully I'm not restricted by such petty matters as time.
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[07:02:07] that's the best way to learn
2018-09-27 12:24:04	qed-office	[07:03:53] furrykef: I can also claim that calculus should be studied for its beauty
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[07:04:19] furrykef: also if you have _any_ questions during the course feel free to ask here
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[07:10:31] I'm sure I'll be fine, but thanks
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[07:53:05] My club game yesterday repeated a game from the hungarian team champs even though my opponent was out of book at move 3
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[07:53:12] I made the same blunder as a 2300 player did
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[07:53:30] This does not entirely make me feel better.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:11:36] At least you're in good company!
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:12:21] Garf: I must say I'm not too impressed with Improve Your Chess Pattern Recognition myself.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:12:36] Like that first chapter on the octopus. I don't really know what to do with an octopus once I've got one.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:14:13] yeah, and what's the used of spaced repetition for that endgame for example?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:14:20] from the first chapter
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:14:31] as to "what to do with it', I think you simply leave it in place
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:14:59] Well yes, but it has to figure into the plan somehow.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:15:57] I don't think my games are going to play themselves as soon as I get an octopus
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:17:54] it greatly restricts the opponents movement, so, somewhat, maybe
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:18:11] I think the point is recognizing the opportunity to make one though
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:18:36] well yes. But getting one does nothing for you if you don't know how to take advantage of it
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:19:37] I suppose the octopus is not really the best example for this point since it does have an effect without really even doing anything
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:24:43] I guess that's a matter for other books to cover
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:29:22] I do like Forcing Chess Moves, but though I'm early in the book, some of the puzzles are quite dfificult
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:29:27] *difficult
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[08:30:20] the intermediates from the woodpecker are hard too for me
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:32:53] Really though, these days I'm looking at chess books mainly for the sake of research for VCC, rather than for my own personal use... though any improvement I can glean from them is a nice side benefit.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:38:48] Oh nice. I just hit my peak blitz tactic rating at ChessTempo (1552.6). Probably due more to a high RD than to any actual recent improvement.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:40:52] Garf, you ever read a book called Formation Attacks, or its sequel, Formation Attack Strategies?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:40:56] I want them, but they're expensive...
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[08:55:41] furrykef: You should probably do calculus at the same time as physics as learning both at the same time reinforces each side and it becomes easier
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[08:56:08] It's like dieting with exercise
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[08:59:26] meh
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:00:43] You seem dismissive?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:00:46] By the way, octopus reminds me of git octopus merge.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:02:21] As for practicalities, electromagnetism is very applied
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:02:55] But Newtonian physics is where you'll see the calculus
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:03:02] Isaac Newton, etc...
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[09:03:17] An octopus as defined in the book is a knight on an outpost on d6 (d3 for black), so called because it reaches in 8 directions to strangle the opponent
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+eyeoh	[09:06:01] ah
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Garf	[10:36:12] furrykef: no, don't know them
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[10:51:32] ah well

2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[10:56:43] just finished 3 pages of calculations, things look good

2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[10:57:08] some paper we are writing atm

2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[10:57:20] oh cool
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[10:57:45] if you are interested in math I can give a linky to the current version of the paper on arxiv
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[10:58:31] I'm very not good at maths
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[10:59:40] ony a few people in the world do math well, alas I am not one of them either
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[11:00:08] If you're doing 3 pages of calcs for a pure math paper I'm sure you're quite alright :)
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:00:23] the paper is 54 pages already
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[11:00:33] Give me the link and I'll tell you after how many syllables I'm stuck
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:00:34] two years to write, 3 authors
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[11:00:49] Is it a proof of some sorts?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:01:05] https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09682
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:01:10] izmar: yes it is a proof
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[11:03:11] Yup, way too complex for me.
2018-09-27 12:24:05	izmar	[11:03:28] What is the significance of your proof?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+tobiasvl	[11:04:16] Sz{\'{e}}kely
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:04:26] there is a very famous problem (study began at 1935) if a certain graph exist, we show that if it exist it has very specific structure
2018-09-27 12:24:05	qed-office	[11:05:21] tobiasvl: yeah I did not bother to remove the '
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+furrykef	[11:54:11] Is there any consensus on who was the "real" world champion during the FIDE/PCA split?
2018-09-27 12:24:05	emajor	[11:57:41] !rating

2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Jik	[12:01:04] furrykef: PCA obviously
2018-09-27 12:24:05	artefact	[12:01:36] fide is still corrupt af
2018-09-27 12:24:05	artefact	[12:01:53] a healthy organisation doesn't get their accounts frozen/suspended
2018-09-27 12:24:05	artefact	[12:02:18] also doesn't organise world championships in countries where some participants will be denied visas
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Jik	[12:02:20] If you think Khalifman, Ponomariov, or Kasimdzhanov are worthy champions, then feel free to go with Fide!
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Jik	[12:02:31] Sometimes i wonder whether fide or fifa is more corrupt
2018-09-27 12:24:05	+Jik	[12:02:52] fifa is just bigger so they can fit more absolute corruption there, but at least football tournaments so far have worked out quite ok

2018-09-28 00:15:42	+eyeoh	It's correct so often that it's demoralising to run it constantly. So I just trust it now and think slower
2018-09-28 00:19:52	+baraba	They are best stockfish moves, but not merely
2018-09-28 00:20:16	+baraba	They are best stockfish moves in a position where there's not other winning moves
2018-09-28 00:20:29	+baraba	-t
2018-09-28 00:21:35	+baraba	after all they are generated using stockfish from games on lichess
2018-09-28 00:22:25	+eyeoh	That's what I just said
2018-09-28 00:22:50	+Momentum	right, a best move is only defined in a certain depth/nodes, the correct answers they suggest are the best moves at a specific depth, SF may change his opinion running for a longer time but it's very unlikely in those sorts of tactics problems
2018-09-28 00:23:25	+eyeoh	There's a suggest better move report function
2018-09-28 00:23:38	+Momentum	okay i don't know about that*
2018-09-28 00:23:43	+eyeoh	But you'd need to beat stockfish on even that "easy" depth
2018-09-28 00:24:19	+eyeoh	Because it'll more than likely thump most of us even when nerfed
2018-09-28 00:24:21	+baraba	it's not what you said, if what you said was true, any position could be a lichess puzzle
2018-09-28 00:25:06	+eyeoh	Isn't that the case?
2018-09-28 00:25:18	+baraba	no
2018-09-28 00:25:27	+baraba	there's a blog post about how these puzzles are generated

2018-09-28 00:26:25	+Momentum	that's a very old one but i think i read it
2018-09-28 00:29:06	+eyeoh	Seems robust to me
2018-09-28 00:29:24	+eyeoh	Even if some solutions don't appear "elegant" or satisfying
2018-09-28 00:30:29	+eyeoh	Unlike CT though, it doesn't train for speed. In fact it penalises speed solves
2018-09-28 00:31:18	+eyeoh	Which still isn't too bad I suppose

2018-09-28 13:28:10	+eyeoh	[04:46:48] No, I'm saying lichess doesn't factor speed in at all
2018-09-28 13:28:10	+furrykef	[04:47:19] I wouldn't say it penalizes speed then
2018-09-28 13:28:10	+eyeoh	[04:47:25] Going fast in lichess results in lower ratings for tactics
2018-09-28 13:28:10	+furrykef	[04:48:14] No, it results in the same rating as doing it slow. You're making it sound like it gives less.
2018-09-28 13:28:10	+eyeoh	[04:48:16] I hit a severe rut by rushing. I'm back over 1600 now but probably haven't actually really improved that much
2018-09-28 13:28:10	+eyeoh	[04:48:57] I don't think what I describe is a false equivalence but I understand what you're all saying

2018-09-28 13:28:10	+eyeoh	[05:06:12] Hmm so what should I play before I head out for the day

2018-09-28 14:20:11	+furrykef	Speaking of force
2018-09-28 14:20:31	+furrykef	Apparently the F used in these physics equations is unsigned. 
2018-09-28 14:21:06	+furrykef	So you have to subtract F if the force is leftward or downward and add it if it's rightward or upward
2018-09-28 14:21:10	+furrykef	This is confusing. Why isn't the sign part of the value of F?

2018-09-28 17:02:38	+Jik	it's like saying that there's no such thing as humans, there are animals and some animals are in the homo sapiens sapiens species.

2018-09-28 17:03:13	+eyeoh	I dunno where you got the idea a teacher told me all this

2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:04:40] Because Reddit seems to have many people who "correct" people by saying there's no deceleration, even though people point to papers and real physicists say that of course you can use the term, and in the end it turns out that they're just citing some random high-school level material
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:04:44] In other news, I've just 'fixed' my first thing while using my new $150 multimeter
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:04:51] a $3 ebay flashlight
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:04:55] Great!
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:04:59] dunno what I did but it works again now
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:05:03] That's a whopping 2 % return of investment right there!
2018-09-28 17:50:34	qed	[17:05:03] very cool eyeoh 
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:05:06] I swear it was shorting...
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:05:09] getting hot etc
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:05:15] And only what, 4 hours?
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:05:55] 2 %-units in 4 hours would be 17500% in a year
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:06:54] (it was actually A$6.63, but it's normally more like $3 if I go for the slow postage)
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:07:02] i.e., china; vs drop shipping
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:07:26] so 4% return!
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+furrykef	[17:07:28] qed: No, I didn't. I can't say I much care, either :P
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:07:32] I hope to eventually fix my tv
2018-09-28 17:50:34	qed	[17:08:02] furrykef, but now you know one more fact about polynomials AND prime numbers ^_^
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+furrykef	[17:09:16] No I don't, because I have the memory of a goldfish :P
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:09:39] ah I think I know what was happening; the +ve terminal area of the light is very close to the negative and that probably had a short until I scraped around a bit
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:10:01] ha
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:10:11] i once fixed a flashlight with a knife and aluminum foil
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:10:18] it's a win
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:10:40] more importantly, I've familiarised myself with the continuity mode and other modes on the meter
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+Jik	[17:10:43] knife to scrap some old shorting conductors, aluminum foil to act as new conductors
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:10:53] foil is so good
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+eyeoh	[17:32:13] lol this overpriced thing https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Swiss-Tech-LED-Pocket-Flashlight/192478639088
2018-09-28 17:50:34	+furrykef	[17:38:49] Fed up with physics. Switching to calculus.

2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[18:47:12] how was chess club furrykef ?
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:03:43] qed: only three people showed up
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:03:48] aside from myself
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:04:10] did you win a few games? :)
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:04:50] I only got to play one and a half. I had a good attack when we had to stop but I don't know if it'd have worked.
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:04:56] And I lost the other game
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:02] oh
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:09] may next time be better
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:13] no more loses
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:05:23] I spent the first 40 minutes just waiting for an opponent... I got so bored I built a tower out of a few pieces
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:05:34] Stacked two rooks, two queens, and a king, IIRC
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:37] lol
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:49] you need an iphone to play with
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:05:55] that's what I do on trains
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:05:58] Or I think it was all four rooks
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:06:21] I have a smartphone but I don't like to use it because its battery just goes foop as soon as you do much with it
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:07:51] But yeah, next week will probably be better
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:08:11] We've had some shitty weather lately and yesterday was a nice day, so people probably did stuff outside instead
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:08:34] come to israel 
2018-09-29 20:30:39	qed	[19:08:39] 40C every day
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:08:43] take a deck of cards and practise cardistry
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:08:57] 40˚C is fine
2018-09-29 20:30:39	 *	furrykef [19:09:09] converts to Fahrenheit
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:09:10] Yeah fuck that.
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:09:11] :P
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:09:36] i'm already feeling uncomfortable over 30C
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:09:49] current temps are just about right
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:09:55] When it's cold you can mitigate it by putting on more clothing
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:10:01] When it's hot, there's only so much clothing you can shed
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:10:30] C = (F-32)/2*1.1
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:10:55] funny how fahrenheit translates to “driveness”
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:11:04] So it does
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:11:06] ∴ F is something like C*0.9*2+32 or close enough
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:11:12] c*9/5 + 32
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:11:19] do that in your head
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:11:32] I suck at mental arithmetic.
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:11:44] No lie, I sometimes still use my fingers to help me add and subtract.
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:11:46] 36*2+32 = 104˚F right
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:11:49] is that close
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:12:11] $wa 40 C in F
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:12:16] irssi says spot on
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:12:26] but quickmaffs in head, do it my way :p
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:12:32] wait i forgot if that even works on this channel
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:12:33] 9/5 is 0.55555555555555
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:12:35] I did better with multiplication because we had to memorize multiplication tables, whereas we didn't do that with addition or subtraction
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:12:50] >9/5 >equals something less than 1
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:12:50] But it's been so long that I'm starting to have a bit of trouble with that too
2018-09-29 20:30:39	artefact	[19:12:51] math is hard.
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:12:56] I wasn't strong at mental maths as a kid cause my mum was too strong
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:13:07] 5/9 oops
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:13:13] I only go F -> C
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:13:16] so I use 5/9
2018-09-29 20:30:39	furrykef	[19:13:34] Just type e.g. "40 c to f" into google :P
2018-09-29 20:30:39	+eyeoh	[19:13:34] OR: C = (F-32)/2 + 10%
2018-09-29 20:30:40	artefact	[19:13:39] i made the kids write programs for both. and because i'm mean, i only let them use fractions
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:13:43] no google at chess club remember
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:13:49] battery/internet
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:13:55] 4G/LTE drains
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:13:56] What's chess club got to do with it?
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:14:04] Besides, I don't mind using it for a few seconds here and there
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:14:09] Just not for minutes at a time
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:11] you said smartphones
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:15] then qed said come to israel
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:23] and now we're talking in a circle
2018-09-29 20:30:40	artefact	[19:14:30] 40c ambient doesn't sound very safe for smartphone usage
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:36] 10% isn't hard to calculate
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:42] it's.. move a decimal place
2018-09-29 20:30:40	artefact	[19:14:48] unless you use tonal.
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:55] so 40: 10% off is 36.
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:14:59] multiply by two, add 32
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:15:22] negative values are a bit trickier; you need to go abs or something
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:15:34] negative = "cold"
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:17:06] if you really want to have fun with calculations, learn to calculate the day of the week from any given date, any century
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:17:14] start with current year
2018-09-29 20:30:40	artefact	[19:17:52] “fun”
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:19:52] ##chess
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:21:07] https://youtu.be/M4vqr3_ROIk?t=11s using brain in ways that seemed impossible before is fun
2018-09-29 20:30:40	artefact	[19:21:27] i do that with psychedelics
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:22:02] km/h = mph * 1.5 + (mph * 1.1)
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:23:23] kg = lbs/2 - 10%
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:23:54] knots is a bit more weird case 1 knot is about 1.85 km/h
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:24:32] feet to metres is simpler; divide ten, times three. ignore the extra bit in most cases
2018-09-29 20:30:40	+eyeoh	[19:25:44] thinking about buying this for the giggles https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Three-Dimensional-3D-Christmas-Tree-LED-DIY-Kit-Red-Green-Yellow-LED-Flash-Circuit-Kit-Electronic/32744769456.html
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:40:38] https://lichess.org/qOBvBlzTzTuZ  epic fail. White initites a classic mating pattern but realizes too late his rook is pinned.
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:40:41] Unfortunately, white was me.
2018-09-29 20:30:40	furrykef	[19:41:44] *initiates
2018-09-29 20:30:40	ornicar	[19:59:43] oof
2018-09-29 20:30:40	ornicar	[19:59:50] that was a very nice mate
2018-09-29 20:30:40	qed	[20:03:28] hi ornicar , how have you been lately?
2018-09-29 20:30:40	ornicar	[20:04:05] great, thanks. On the way back from a bicycle trip to Barcelona.
2018-09-29 20:30:40	ornicar	[20:04:07] you?
2018-09-29 20:30:40	qed	[20:04:27] I am fine thank you :)
2018-09-29 20:30:40	qed	[20:04:46] glad to hear that you are having much fun over there
2018-09-29 20:30:40	xcombelle	[20:05:37] :( furrykef

2018-09-30 17:39:21	atchoum	[16:43:47] do you have to know all openings + variants by heart to play chess correctly ?
2018-09-30 17:39:21	@qed	[16:45:35] people will forgive you if you won't learn the a3 opening lines
2018-09-30 17:39:21	furrykef	[16:59:41] Memorizing openings is only a major part of the game at high levels
2018-09-30 17:39:21	furrykef	[17:00:21] You should understand the most important lines of your favorite openings, and you should know basic opening principles, but that's about it
2018-09-30 17:39:21	+beeman	[17:05:01] Hi

2018-09-30 17:39:21	furrykef	[17:08:58] done
2018-09-30 17:39:21	@qed	[17:09:05] thanks furrykef

2018-09-30 17:39:21	@qed	[17:09:20] this works beeman 
2018-09-30 17:39:21	@qed	[17:09:34] I am pretty useless as an op
2018-09-30 17:39:21	furrykef	[17:09:57] BTW it only affects unregistered users. Registered users can talk without voice
2018-09-30 17:39:21	@qed	[17:11:37] oh now I understand what happened beeman authenticated after joining the channel probably
2018-09-30 17:39:21	furrykef	[17:12:09] beeman says it's not working
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:12:10] hmm
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:12:24] oh, I know why
2018-09-30 17:39:22	+beeman	[17:13:08] Oh that's weird
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:13:08] oh.. the infamous irccloud issue
2018-09-30 17:39:22	+beeman	[17:14:45] I'm using irccloud trial so.. I'm login to all channels and after 7 days re-registered..
2018-09-30 17:39:22	ChaiTRex	[17:19:41] it weird, they should get rid of multiplicative identity
2018-09-30 17:39:22	ChaiTRex	[17:19:47] manish: you know how to compute the the values
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:22:15] beeman, try installing hexchat instead
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:22:24] it's a good irc client
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:22:29] and its free
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:23:25] beeman is a new member in our channel, please welcome him guys
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:23:42] greetings

2018-09-30 17:39:22	+beeman	[17:24:52] Thanks 😀 but I used hexchat but I don't like it much.
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:25:54] beeman, maybe you will like mirc better then
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:26:52] mIRC is demoware, though
2018-09-30 17:39:22	+beeman	[17:26:55] I'm not in favor of irc clients. I use irccloud and I'm writing from my phone.
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:27:19] beeman, I wanted to install it on my iphone too (irccloud)
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:27:31] I did not do it only for one reason, many channel simply ban irccloud
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:27:40] that's the problem you could not talk before
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:28:10] You'll want to put the +q on $~a if we start getting spam again, BTW
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:28:17] *back on
2018-09-30 17:39:22	+beeman	[17:28:32] Till now I know that only #programming ban irccloud users.
2018-09-30 17:39:22	furrykef	[17:28:38] which means nick registration or voice would be required again to speak
2018-09-30 17:39:22	@qed	[17:33:43] furrykef, put it back please

2018-09-30 19:50:10	+eyeoh	[18:11:20] atchoum: agadmator suggests that beginners not even focus on openings and instead work on end games. Meanwhile, Ben Finegold suggests focusing on undefended pieces.
2018-09-30 19:50:10	+eyeoh	[18:11:53] personally I've just been sticking to a few 'favourite' openings and then playing it by ear after the first few moves
2018-09-30 19:50:10	artefact	[18:23:45] every time you say “raaaaawr” during a game, you gain 50 elo

2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[18:57:09] I've always wanted to write a parody of Think Like a Grandmaster called Think Like a Graham Cracker

2018-09-30 19:50:10	artefact	[19:07:56] soon to be published, “get your teeth removed like a grandmaster”

2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:19:49] He called me when I had like 6 seconds left on my clock.
2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:22:28] Oh well. The game I played before that one was pretty nice: https://lichess.org/Ckeb5DM3
2018-09-30 19:50:10	@qed	[19:25:31] beautiful game furrykef 
2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:25:36] Thanks
2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:26:54] I think I'm getting pretty comfortable with the Ruy Lopez now. The problem is all the other openings you get into with 1.e4
2018-09-30 19:50:10	artefact	[19:27:25] you don't play the london anymore?
2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:28:20] I didn't say that.
2018-09-30 19:50:10	furrykef	[19:29:18] I don't play the King's Gambit anymore, though. Found out black had a certain response that turned me off completely.
2018-09-30 19:50:10	artefact	[19:30:44] the falkbeer?
2018-09-30 19:50:10	notzmv	[19:32:48] lmao

2018-09-30 19:55:58	furrykef	hm?
2018-09-30 19:56:52	notzmv	I actually might want to play that as black, seems decent
2018-09-30 19:56:58	notzmv	but it doesn't feel that critical
2018-09-30 19:57:13	notzmv	I guess Nf6 is kind of a killjoy lol
2018-09-30 19:57:20	furrykef	It's still playable as white but I didn't really want to deal with it
2018-09-30 19:57:51	notzmv	agree
2018-09-30 19:58:05	notzmv	you could always play the vienna if you want something in that f4 style too
2018-09-30 19:58:29	notzmv	it's not bad at all, and it's pretty decent at your skill level
2018-09-30 19:59:04	notzmv	like black can mostly equalize with d5 and stuff but it's very playable

2018-09-30 20:51:24	whomsoever	yeah
2018-09-30 20:51:27	notzmv	so black has to find something more urgent than that

2018-10-01 11:17:54	ghostdude	[02:29:33] it's pretty funny throwing games in anonymous
2018-10-01 11:17:54	ghostdude	[02:29:37] hanging games on purpose etc
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[02:48:04] anonymous is the worst
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[02:48:10] no cheat detection
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[02:48:14] people being rude
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[02:48:15] etc.
2018-10-01 11:17:54	flapz	[02:57:51] ye, hate that guy, "anonymous", he's always playing an ungodly amount of games at the same time.. it's ridiculous
2018-10-01 11:17:54	ghostdude	[03:16:34] theres no point trying in anonymous
2018-10-01 11:17:54	ghostdude	[03:16:47] they'll leave when you win.
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[03:17:37] https://lichess.org/q0IQ6nZ8
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[03:20:06] and he left
2018-10-01 11:17:54	+baraba	[03:20:10] who this?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+baraba	[03:20:21] lol
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+beeman	[06:09:35] Just trying some app. Said "try 5 days for free" it's free then why you want me to pay after it?🤔 Im trying  chess trainer app
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+beeman	[06:10:33] It seems for education when you have money and time you can be the smartest
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[06:31:09] yeah i don't trust anything that's "free"
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[06:31:22] nothing's free
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[06:54:58] lichess is free
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[06:55:08] always has been, always will be
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ent681	[06:58:48] lichess is really good.  I recommend it
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:25:07] not free for me though. 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:26:36] what do you mean?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:30:11] They banned me
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:30:20] so I have to pay VPN to use it 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:30:23] so it's not free
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:32:21] You might want to know ornicar is the guy who created and runs lichess.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:32:29] Oh I know
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:32:32] he's the one who banned me
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:33:00] You probably deserve it then
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:34:11] if you believe people can easily be offended on the internet
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:34:47] its 2018, no one gets offended with verbal insults. 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:35:40] they see someone cursing and want to see him banned, they're laughing on their end.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:38:01] Seems like an attitude problem
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:38:17] Did you swear in chat?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:38:27] yeah that's one of the main themes
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:38:35] Oooh, you trash talked didn't you?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:38:40] heavily
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:38:46] If you got banned over what you say in chat you must have said something really bad
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:38:48] the people reported me were trollish as well
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:38:51] I don't know why people bother with that. It's juvenile
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:38:58] Now you're sobbing
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:39:03] nah, i got banned saying the same thing over and over
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:39:09] Normally they just take away your chat privileges or something
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:39:09] No contrition
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:39:29] the mods at lichess already know my insults before they are said.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	+eyeoh	[07:39:48] This is boring, I'm going for a bike ride. Enjoy
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:39:53] enjoy
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:40:35] or maybe you were planning to go for a bike ride regardless 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:41:02] and not as an effect of being bored of the chat
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:41:16] I'm riding my bike today as well!
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:41:21] oh 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:41:22] enjoy
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:41:32] Gonna cover about 100km hopefuly, in spite of front winds
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:41:41] stay safe then
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:41:58] from Toulouse to Agen (France)
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:42:25] damn thats 62 miles
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:42:32] not possible
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:42:54] it's mostly flat
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:43:02] that's 4-5 hour ride
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:43:29] maybe 3 i dont know , i don't math anymore.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:46:12] well.. enjoy . i bet you have thick calf muscles. 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:46:21] im gonna continue vpning into your site. 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:51:43] kind of wish i didn't have to tho
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:52:12] you keep asking me to unban, and you never even told me your username
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:52:21] i thought you knew who i was
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:52:29] annexation
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:52:36] never heard that name before
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:52:45] ok maybe wasnt you who banned
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:52:51] banned 3 months ago
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:52:53] we got loads of trolls, don't take it personally
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:52:59] ok im sorry
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:53:42] sad to say, but lichess is the only website i feel motivated about chess so that's why i keep coming back
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:54:02] so if you would reconsider, that would be great
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:54:22] I checked your comms and concluded that you are a terrible person. You can keep using the vpn
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:54:31] lol
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:54:42] but it's the same insult that got me banned
2018-10-01 11:17:55	 *	furrykef [07:54:51] is unsurprised by this outcome
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:55:02] dude i haven't trolled like that in months
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:55:09] which insult do you think it is?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:55:17] "cancer" type 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:55:20] of course you haven't: you're shadowbanned
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:55:25] people tell me to die from cancer all the time
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:55:30] how can that be an insult that works
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:55:55] how about "mexican faggot" or "boning ur mother" or "lol you fucking bitch"?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:05] man, my best f riend is mexican
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:07] lol
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:56:19] ...did you really just say that
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:22] i'm not a racist
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:25] 100% swear to god
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:56:28] ^^
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:56:34] "My best friend is [race]" is the oldest one in the book
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:35] i'm not even white
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:56:39] i'm Asian, how can i be racist
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:57:06] Asians can't be racist? WTF.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:57:11] yup
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:57:13] we cant
2018-10-01 11:17:55	furrykef	[07:58:13] So if you point a gun at a black person and say "Get out of my yard you fucking nigger", there's nothing racist about that?
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:58:27] what lol
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:58:38] not sure what you talkin about man.
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:58:59] People like me in real life. 
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:59:23] but on lichess, people block you
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ornicar	[07:59:29] try playing chess IRL idk
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:59:32] and lichess thinks i have  anger problem
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:59:37] it's just typing
2018-10-01 11:17:55	ghostdude	[07:59:46] like.. when i type it.. i donm't feel angry
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[07:59:57] I couldn't care less how you feel
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:00:00] If you're calling people "faggot" and telling people to get cancer, you certainly have a problem of *some* kind.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:00:16] it's the same tiring insult that i know doesn't work on people
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:00:31] its like a bullet game
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:00:35] you move on quick
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:00:42] why would people be emotional and get offended
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:00:48] You're not in their shoes, dude.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:01:06] dude, you should also check the stuff they say to me
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:01:11] I don't give a fuck.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:01:11] theyre like "HAHAHHAHAHA" etc
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:01:15] nope
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:01:32] your insults were spontaneous, every time
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:01:47] they don't make any sense
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:01:55] you are the very reason why we need to monitor communications and implement mod tools
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:02:02] instead of chess features
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:02:07] look have you had any  reports lately?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:02:12] in the past 3 months
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:02:18] I was once playing Heroes of the Storm and one of my teammates didn't like how I was playing and he said "kill yourself irl" or something along those lines
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:02:20] And you know what?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:02:22] i haven't done anything
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:02:28] i cleaned up
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:02:39] I was having one of the worst days of my entire life and I was thinking of doing just that.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:03:01] lol you're lying
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:03:07] to make a case
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:03:48] No. No I was not.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:04:00] thanks
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:21:02] It'll just be a 24-hour ban, though I'm really tempted to make it longer
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:21:24] But I don't think he's done anything in here that's bad enough to warrant a longer ban
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:23:24] He will be on thin ice, though.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[08:31:18] I'm going to let him back on lichess with some conditions
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:36:49] okay.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	furrykef	[08:39:30] Guess I don't see much point leaving the IRC ban on, then
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:40:44] thanks guys!
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:40:49] i won't let you down.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ghostdude	[08:41:04] @ furrykef  @ ornicar 
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[09:02:03] I can see all tactics, but I can't analyze my way through variations.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[09:02:07] Another +6 game lost this weekend.
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[09:16:15] haha, my FIDE blitz isn't even terrible
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:38:31] TIL chess.com loads 900KB of ads and trackers on its main page. lichess main page total weight is 300KB. So on chess.com you load the equivalent of 3 lichess, just for ads and tracking
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:38:37] pretty funny istn't it
2018-10-01 11:17:56	mursu	[10:41:32] pretty normal
2018-10-01 11:17:56	mursu	[10:41:52] that's not even the worst I've seen
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:43:25] what are you working on these days ornicar? I assume the server migration, but any plans after that?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:44:07] adding more study features, and the broadcast, mainly
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:44:45] ornicar: I wish lichess was more prominent in Google Play - I ignored it for years because of the odd name and basic logo
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:45:07] fixing what breaks day after day. We now have a lot of services doing various tasks, and at least one of them is always failing
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:45:13] only agadmator let me know lichess exists
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:45:35] we don't pay for ads and search placement, so...
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:45:56] given the growth of the userbase it seems to be ok
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:46:10] if people look up something chess related they will hear about lichess sooner or later
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:46:18] I'll have to drop dead before the lichess donation money goes to paying google
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:46:19] <ghostdude> or maybe you were planning to go for a bike ride regardless | and not as an effect of being bored of the chat
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:46:22] yeah usually, but what time I leave varies
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:46:54] ornicar: I'm still hoping for a more fluid layout someday :P
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:47:16] yeah that's a huge work, that can only add bugs, and will be immensely hated
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:47:26] OMG CHANGE
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:47:33] <hate>
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:48:30] ornicar: tiny bug: in analysis mode, the "master" db is reported as going to 2016
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:48:36] ornicar: but I'm sure it's more up to date than that
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:48:47] ok
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:49:06] reading scrollback, it turns out my assessment was correct; chat was boring and not worth delaying a ride for
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:49:28] https://lichess.org/YCN3hQOy
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:49:33] i.e. this is a mid 2017 game
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:50:27] wait where did you see 2016
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:50:47] Two million OTB games of 2200+ FIDE rated players from 1952 to 2018
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:50:50] is what I see
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:51:06] I see 2016
2018-10-01 11:17:56	ornicar	[10:51:14] on the app?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:52:10] no, the site
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:53:16] https://irccloud.mozilla.com/file/O8wJUS3d/orni2016.png
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:57:10] "masterDbExplanation":"Two million OTB games, by 2200+ FIDE rated players, from 1952 to 2016"
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[10:59:27] how do I get regexp to match "2016"?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[10:59:41] just "2016"
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:00:04] doesn't work with irssi lastlog hmm
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:00:34] I'll duckduckgo
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:01:53] Garf: what do you want to match exactly? "just 2016" doesn't cut it, unless you really just want to match the string "2016". in that case the regex to match it is obviously /2016/
2018-10-01 11:17:56	Garf	[11:02:07] why are you asking me
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:02:10] do you mean you want to match a "four digit number at the end of a string"?
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:02:30] ah
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:02:32] oh sorry
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:02:33] eyeoh: ^
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:02:33] /lastlog -regexp \b2016\b
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:02:52] yeah that'll work
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:03:03] I'm trying to figure out what this 2016 refers to
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:03:14] I see now
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+tobiasvl	[11:03:32] in that case you should've asked "how do I get regexp to match '2016' as a separate word" :P defining rexes with vague natural language is hard
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:03:46] we got there
2018-10-01 11:17:56	+eyeoh	[11:04:19] your /2016/ idea helped
2018-10-01 11:17:57	+eyeoh	[11:04:36] https://github.com/irssi/irssi/issues/558 I'm not the only one who is a newbie
2018-10-01 11:17:57	+eyeoh	[11:06:45] The hardest part of troubleshooting is 42
2018-10-01 11:17:57	+eyeoh	[11:07:18] if we all knew the right questions, we'd know everything
2018-10-01 11:17:57	+eyeoh	[11:08:04] learned something today again in freenode ##chess

2018-10-01 12:32:30	furrykef	<Garf> I can see all tactics, but I can't analyze my way through variations.
2018-10-01 12:32:35	furrykef	Sometimes you just gotta let the hippo drown
2018-10-01 12:33:08	Garf	yeah but unlike tal my intuition picks the losing lines
2018-10-01 12:33:22	+Jik	It's amazing that carlsen hasn't lost his 1st place even though it's been close so often
2018-10-01 12:34:00	ornicar	ok Garf it's a translation issue. Some have 2016 hardcoded instead of taking the third argument given by https://github.com/ornicar/lila/blob/9b5ea47cbd6369e5301d6211af43284d081d0222/ui/analyse/src/explorer/explorerConfig.ts#L76
2018-10-01 12:34:20	+Jik	He has held it since July 2011
2018-10-01 12:34:22	ornicar	I assume it's because you use US english, instead of default english
2018-10-01 12:34:34	Garf	probably
2018-10-01 12:34:46	ornicar	you can fix it on https://crowdin.com/project/lichess if you feel like it
2018-10-01 12:34:59	Garf	and so, 1.5 hours of lichess development time was lost. rip.
2018-10-01 12:36:13	ornicar	haha no I was out buying a ridiculous blow horn for my bike, so people stop thinking I'm a serious cyclist

2018-10-01 12:39:38	Garf	ok github works
2018-10-01 12:40:08	ornicar	no you can't do it on github, it has to be crowdin - or else it will be overwritten
2018-10-01 12:40:21	ornicar	I won't be mad if you give up
2018-10-01 12:40:24	furrykef	I would say they'll stop thinking you're a serious cyclist and start thinking you're Harpo Marx... but I dunno how many people these days know who Harpo Marx was.

2018-10-01 20:12:54	+Jik	[15:09:26]  And how do you count go's score after the game ends?
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:10:16] There are different rulesets for that. The one I use is the simplest: fill all territory you own with stones of your color. Whoever has the most stones on the board wins the game.
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:10:38] If there's a dispute over who controls what territory, play it out.
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:10:45] furrykef, it's 3 that confuses me
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:13:00] It's straightforward enough to me. You're not allowed to take away the last liberty of one of your own groups unless it's to capture enemy stones (capturing enemy stones overrides self-capture).
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:14:03] that's as if there's a time sequence and destruction of the enemy occurs before the piece is placed
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:14:27] sounds like the go equivalent of a pinned piece giving check
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:14:39] artefact: probably a fair comparison
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:14:54] disclaimer, i've never played go. i don't even know the rules
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:15:11] i remember looking at them one time and was quickly put off by the complexity
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:15:17] also, i like chess
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:15:21] The complexity?!
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:15:25] Go's rules are as simple as checkers
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:15:49] international?
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:15:58] they are not, they are highly interdependent
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:16:09] go is a complex game
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:16:13] but the rules aren't complex
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:17:05] i would prefer it if the rules were completely independent of each other 
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:17:16] what do you mean? the ko rule?
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:18:43] i don't know what i mean
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:19:48] yeah judging from what you and furrykef said above, probably the ko rule
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:20:05] ie. "The move does not repeat the position as it was after your previous move"
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:20:07] maybe
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:21:11] He said it was rule #3 that confused him, the suicide rule
2018-10-01 20:12:54	prsstnt	[15:22:02] only because i see people jump into the middle of enemy and somehow that is a success
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:23:06] Taking your opponent's stones takes priority over taking your own stones. After you see it a few times it should be intuitive enough
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+Jik	[15:24:46] if the rule is "The move does not repeat the position as it was after your previous move" how does go deal with multiple kos giving repeated positions?
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:25:46] Jik:  a good question that there's no real answer to
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:25:47] That's called a superko
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:25:59] Some rulesets forbid repeating any previous position
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:26:13] furrykef: I've tried to jump on the Go bandwagon twice in my life. One time was in school when friend said it was cool. The next time was with the AlphaGo thing.
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+tobiasvl	[15:26:15] https://senseis.xmp.net/?Superko
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:26:24] in conclusion, I should probably stick to chess
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:26:34] Go is hard for westerners to get into
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:26:39] I kind of want to know what bridge is like though, but most players are old
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:27:20] seeing the alphago matches progress at a pace slower than chess was eye opening
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:27:36] like move 2: 5 minutes to think
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:27:42] I'm not too impressed by Bridge
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:27:46] and the commentators are going nuts
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:28:02] (I slightly exagerrate)
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:28:20] *exaggerate
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:28:25] weird word
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:28:42] Poker is a great game, but it's hard to get people to take it seriously when it's for play money, and people get too nasty when it's for real money
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:28:59] I feel that I've long missed the boat on poker
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:29:03] all the cool kids already are too good
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:29:09] there's no gain for me in starting now
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:29:24] It's certainly much harder to make a profit starting now than in, say, 2004
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:29:28] oh nice, the moon is a half right now
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:29:38] or quarter
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:29:42] We'll probably never see a poker boom that big again
2018-10-01 20:12:54	artefact	[15:29:48] know the saying, the best time for X was $n years ago, the second best time is today
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:30:05] in a closed environment yes
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:30:13] except the world is open and there's competing activities
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:30:21] Eh. If you're looking to make a profit in poker the best time to start is certainly not now.
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:30:26] If you're looking to play for fun then maybe.
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:30:43] (The second-best time to start is not now either)
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:30:43] there's only 24 hours in a day, and so many weeks in a lifetime: https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:30:54] I just see no incentive to take up poker of any form
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:30:59] not even fun
2018-10-01 20:12:54	furrykef	[15:31:21] It has a hidden beauty to it, the same way chess does
2018-10-01 20:12:54	+eyeoh	[15:31:22] bicycle, piano, chess, maybe bridge, electronics; that takes up a lot already
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:31:33] yeah most things have hidden beauty
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:31:49] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMMRi1i8NUc
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[15:32:11] that's not how venn diagrams work
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:32:25] hmm did I link the wrong thing
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:32:47] nah I think I got it
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:33:08] disclosure: I don't drink alcohol these days
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:33:15] so how could I even start poker
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:33:36] Just like with Settlers of Catan, I've seen it from the sidelines
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:33:50] But do you have wood for sheep?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[15:34:02] typical furry speak
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:34:11] lol
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:34:41] >:|
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:38:41] Bahh. I'm failing at simple differentiation
2018-10-01 20:12:55	bosspotato	[15:43:05] don't do that
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:45:38] Thanks, bosspotato. That's a big help.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:45:58] I think I don't understand limits quite as well as I thought.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:51:27] Hmm. I think I'm starting to get it.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[15:52:23] furrykef, if you have specific questions be sure to ask
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[15:56:16] noted
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:09] simple differentiation is mechanical
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:17] you don't need to understand limits to get started
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:25] but oddly lessons seem to cover limits first
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:36] just move on and revisit later if confused
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:39] you'll be fine
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[15:59:48] that's not the way we studied.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[15:59:56] first: a strong foundation of limits
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[15:59:57] enlighten us
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:00:09] then: diffrentiation
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:00:23] I'm learning differentiation in terms of limits
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:00:31] yes
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:01:04] f'(x) = lim h->0 (f(x+h)-f(x))/h as far as I remember
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:01:05] you'll figure it out. Just go forwards and back and forwards again
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:01:11] I'm getting it now
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:01:14] sometimes it helps to look ahead at the same time
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:01:38] strong foundations are good but I believe they're occasionally idealistic and perfectionistic
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:01:52] try to start perfectly and you'll never start
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:02:26] without strong foundations a tower can not be built, only a hut
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:03:08] you haven't seen [country] construction then ;)
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:03:32] What would you say is a strong foundation for getting into cycling?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:05:17] I never cycled
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:05:20] math I do for a living
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:06:06] a very base a crude form of math (combinatorics) but nonetheless :)
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:06:11] *base and crude
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:07:12] furrykef: where do you want to go with this maths?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:10:11] base? i'm more into acid
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:10:52] apparently bicarb soda will help to remove old sticky plastic
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:11:12] the two Nexus 4s in my possession have icky side plastic/rubber things now
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:11:58] if you've ever worked in the symmetric group S_n then you've probably cycled before, qed 
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:13:47] we did way too much group actions with S_n
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:14:03] relationship ended with S_n, now H(C) is my best friend
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:23:12] artefact, yes I remember S_n and A_n fondly
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:28:18] eyeoh: I just want to understand math well enough that I don't have to run away screaming anytime I come across some
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:29:35] My most immediate goal is to understand enough math to understand the underlying mathematics of MCTS
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:29:44] artefact, are you still in pain my friend?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:29:57] i'm drugged, so not at the moment, no
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:30:05] OK
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:31:22] furrykef: Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:31:36] monte carlo tree search
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:31:59] hmm acronymfinder is broken
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:32:36] and what do you want to do with MCTS?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[16:34:13] game tree traversal
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:39:33] It's part of my Virtual Chess Coach engine
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:39:39] or at least it will be
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+eyeoh	[16:41:59] ah
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:54:51] Heh, I'm a little puzzled. The lectures for the power rule say d/dx [x^n] = nx^(n-1) where n≠0, then later state that if n=0 then the derivative will always be 0
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:55:01] But... that's the case with the rule too, isn't it? Why special-case it?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[16:55:26] i.e. 0x^(0-1) is also 0 for any x, is it not?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:56:42] x^-1 is undefined for x=0
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:56:57] that is 0 * (1/0) != 0 in math
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[16:57:11] in math this is an undefined expression
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:05:22] ah
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:06:00] But that goes for nx^(n-1), too.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:06:14] Hmm
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:06:18] n/m
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:07:02] No, wait, it does. If n is -3 for example, then you get -3x^(-4), which is undefined for x=0.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:07:13] So the n≠0 exception doesn't help there.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	+Jik	[17:07:56] I think the invention is to note that it's different in the sense that you can't get the antiderivative of x^(-1) from this
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:18:14] what's the problem with n=-3?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:18:22] you can't expect a function to have a derivative where it isn't defined
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:34:47] I was just pointing out that what qed said seems to be irrelevant
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:35:48] well, f(x)=k has a zero derivative everywhere, whereas the formula would give something that's undefined at zero
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:36:01] but that's not a problem for more negative values of n, bc the expression itself is undefined at zero
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:36:46] technically, f()=x^0 is also undefined at zero, if you're being pedantic
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:37:04] ah
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:37:31] Okay, I see now.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:37:34] Thanks.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:38:02] what i tell my students is that if the formula makes sense, it's valid
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:38:11] for derivatives, that is
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[17:38:55] there are worse examples furrykef , for example f(x)=|x| is defined for x=0 but it has no derivative there
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:39:22] Which makes sense 'cause its graph takes a hard turn there
2018-10-01 20:12:55	@qed	[17:39:55] yes
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:40:04] f(x)=Σ_0^\infty cos(2^nx)/2^n is also funny
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:42:11] Heh, I haven't gotten to infinite sums yet.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:47:35] I'm surprised that differentiation of polynomials is so easy.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:47:44] Polynomials make almost everything else a pain in the ass.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:49:13] how so?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:49:42] Dividing polynomials is a pain for example.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:50:18] there's algorithms. it's fundamentally no different from long integer division
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[17:50:36] polynomials are so convenient, that's why power series are a thing
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:51:00] Long integer division is a pain too.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:53:25] I hated it so much. In 5th grade our teacher taught us an alternative algorithm he called the "Russian method" that involved repeated subtraction, and from then on I always used it instead of long division... until I forgot it. Which was probably by the very next school year.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:53:37] Eventually I rediscovered it but by that point I didn't have to do division by hand anymore.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:57:16] I still consider it a superior method for dividing integers, though.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[17:58:17] Anyway. Derivatives are boring. I wanna get to integrals so I can draw lots of skinny S's.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[18:09:13] I have to admit I'm not entirely clear on why calculus is distinguished from algebra. Seems to me to have more to do with its historical development than anything else.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:10:02] algebra usually doesn't involve limits, or epsilons
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[18:10:15] Yeah, but who decided that and why?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:45:31] for first I like algebra and dislike calculus
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:45:49] I did not decide to dislike calculus
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[18:47:26] :P
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:48:36] qed f(x)=|x| has a derivative in the distribution sense (if someone don't know see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(mathematics) )
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:50:45] distributions are really cool
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:50:54] laurent schwartz made his thesis on them, iirc
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:51:01] (hence the name)
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[18:51:29] I'm guessing that's rather beyond my level
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:52:50] i don't really know any cool applications, though
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:53:48] Laurent schwarts made the name
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:53:58] furrykef: it is not that hard
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:54:08] if you know what integration is
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:54:12] the dirac distribution is also rigorously defined
2018-10-01 20:12:55	artefact	[18:54:15] which is really cool
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:55:05] twice the dirac distribution is the derivative of |x| in 0
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[18:55:18] unless I mistake
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[19:17:16] d/dx (sin(x)) = cos(x)
2018-10-01 20:12:55	 *	furrykef [19:17:22] 's head explodes. Violently.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[19:26:23] d/dx (e^x) = e^x
2018-10-01 20:12:55	 *	furrykef [19:26:35] 's head explodes again. Violentlier.
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[19:33:42] d/dx (3e^x)=3e^x 
2018-10-01 20:12:55	 *	xcombelle [19:34:05] 's hrad explodes again. Violently?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	furrykef	[19:35:44] Nah, that's pretty obvious given d/dx (e^x) = e^x
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[19:36:12] so why e=2.68 then furrykef ?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	xcombelle	[19:36:35] and not 3 times ?
2018-10-01 20:12:55	 *	furrykef [19:36:54] doesn't follow
2018-10-01 20:12:56	artefact	[19:42:45] e is closer to 2.72 than to 2.68
2018-10-01 20:12:56	 *	xcombelle [19:45:40] does not know e
2018-10-01 20:12:56	xcombelle	[19:57:44] my mistake |x| derivate is some kind of heavyside function so it is the derivate second which is some kind of dirac distribution
2018-10-01 20:12:56	furrykef	[19:58:40] Now you're just speaking Greek
2018-10-01 20:12:56	bosspotato	[19:58:54] in fact they are
2018-10-01 20:12:56	artefact	[20:01:32] makes sense xcombelle 
2018-10-01 20:12:56	xcombelle	[20:02:29] heavyside is the functiohn which is 0 on R- and 1 on R+ furrykef 
2018-10-01 20:12:56	artefact	[20:03:17] it's the step function
2018-10-01 20:12:56	artefact	[20:03:30] useful for engineers mostly

2018-10-02 03:01:10	+Momentum	well, i don't want to have such a responsibility, after all i feel like banning people should an irrelevant thing nowadays, i don't see any reason why people should get banned
2018-10-02 03:01:20	+Momentum	especially on IRC
2018-10-02 03:02:04	+baraba	controversial

2018-10-02 03:02:58	+Momentum	it's controversial indeed, but that's what i think at least
2018-10-02 03:03:50	+Momentum	of course it's me who wanted Twipply to be banned forever
2018-10-02 03:05:13	flapz	If Twipply was here, he would pester you for hours for that apparent contradiction until you finally conceded you were somewhat wrong on the internet
2018-10-02 03:05:30	+Momentum	he still doesn't understand that banning is irrelevant until he gets banned enough times to realize it

2018-10-02 03:08:23	flapz	oh no takers, well cheers anyway, and cheers, I'm out
2018-10-02 03:08:44	+Momentum	you can ask him to unban you if you want him

2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:24:33] furrykef: how often do you play at the club?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:25:11] and how long are the time controls?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:26:50] The club meets every Friday and we don't use clocks. It's a real casual club.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:27:00] how long are the meets?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:27:25] An hour and a half to two hours (officially an hour and a half but they usually let us stay for two)
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:27:36] We have a guy named Jaime who brings a clock and likes to play 10 mins per side, but he's the only regular who brings one.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:27:53] I've only beaten him three times ever and the clock is probably a big part of why. I need time to think!
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:28:16] I'd rather win one slow game than lose three fast ones.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:28:19] is the Lichess app's clock any good for otb?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:28:25] I've never experienced it
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:28:27] No clue.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:28:35] you do know there is one inside that app right?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:28:46] I don't think my phone can even run the app.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:28:54] o.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:29:05] Plus my phone's battery drains like water in a bathtub.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:29:12] which is it?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:29:13] ya, how about trying him on a 15+15 furrykef?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:29:27] you'd do well
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:29:38] 15+15 feels comfortable until you get a somewhat stronger opponent and you end up with 1 minute and they 16
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:29:42] any idea about his online rating?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:29:50] whomsoever: Maybe. I dunno. I kinda suck at OTB play even when there's no clock. It's hard to see the board properly
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:29:58] eyeoh: HTC Evo 4G
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:30:05] is it a standard board size?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:30:06] ah
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:30:13] I've seen so many bad boards
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:30:18] or large pieces on small boards
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:30:19] worst
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:30:25] Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're tournament sets or close to it
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:30:40] white and green?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:30:46] wow 2010 phone; you're getting good life out of it
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:31:01] :s green?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:31:25] Jaime's got a blitz rating of 1584 at chess.com.
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:31:27] yeah, I've seen tournament sheets that were white and green
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:31:39] Our boards are black and white. Rather boring, really
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:31:45] Jaime brings his own and it is indeed green and white
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:31:47] full black?
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:31:50] yeah
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:32:00] hmm
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:32:10] maybe that might be a reason you can't 'see' it
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:32:18] although you said green too
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:32:31] I find white and brown to be most relaxing
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:32:56] and green off-putting; fortunately I found the button to change that on chess.com
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:33:28] Green and white is my favorite combination for some reason
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:33:34] interesting
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:33:37] I'll give it another chance
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:33:43] I didn't even realise it was a thing
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:33:50] < more of a white and blue type
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:33:57] that also I haven't seen...
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:34:00] I'm so fresh
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:34:06] Might be because my Omega Chess set also had green and white squares
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:34:18] haha
2018-10-02 12:10:16	whomsoever	[04:34:21] habits!
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:34:30] I was pretty fond of that set... I might ask Bob for it back sometime :P
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:34:32] Probably not, though
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:34:36] well I mean chess.com defaults to white and green so it must have some popularity
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:34:46] I let him borrow it 'cause I was tired of him calling me asking questions about it
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:34:54] (Bob likes making chess variants)
2018-10-02 12:10:16	furrykef	[04:35:29] Yesterday he and I played some abomination that combined checkers, chess, and Chinese Chess. I knew it was a mistake to introduce him to Chinese Chess. :|
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:42:48] lol
2018-10-02 12:10:16	+eyeoh	[04:42:59] I've played chinese chess but can't remember the rules

2018-10-02 12:10:17	bosspotato	[05:09:54] 1) don't play bullet
2018-10-02 12:10:17	bosspotato	[05:10:00] 2) don't play 3+0
2018-10-02 12:10:17	bosspotato	[05:10:04] 3) actually play
2018-10-02 12:10:17	whomsoever	[05:10:10] 4) that's right

2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:11:11] agree
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:11:20] The problem is I would need to invest a decent amount of time to improve like 100 rating points
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:11:21] bullet aids
2018-10-02 12:10:18	notzmv	[05:11:28] agree
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:11:28] And where would that bring me

2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:11:50] it's not about the rating
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:12:06] yeah, what is it about?
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:12:13] notzmv we've been missing your presence for quite a while now m8
2018-10-02 12:10:18	notzmv	[05:12:19] agree
2018-10-02 12:10:18	notzmv	[05:12:26] actually I'm off to bed soon :^)
2018-10-02 12:10:18	notzmv	[05:12:35] as soon as those beans let me sleep
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:12:48] yeah, me too, rip, 6am
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:13:29] baraba: it's about keeping your brain up to lots of stuff
2018-10-02 12:10:18	notzmv	[05:13:40] true
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:14:31] Is that a myth, or is there a study or something
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+baraba	[05:14:39] anyway, better read some dank books instead
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:14:40] nn
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:14:48] Synadze has the proofs
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:15:04] nite 
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:22:33] baraba: reading books is gr8 too, whilst playing chess could be as well, it's probably a matter of sharing spare time through your main activities
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:23:46] that said, looking forward to a classical game against you baraba :o
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+eyeoh	[05:26:30] bullet is only for strong players isn't it
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:27:28] not really
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:28:33] being fast in bullet is more important than being strong 
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:31:39] there are 2000 bullet rated players who are 1600s rated in blitz/classical
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:31:48] it's pretty relative
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:40:43] but also not usually that spaced between ratings
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:41:29] so it's all about specific habits
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+eyeoh	[05:45:15] I suppose winning on time can be a sole technique
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+eyeoh	[05:45:34] I see how that'd be destructive to classical
2018-10-02 12:10:18	whomsoever	[05:47:41] classical implies deeper calculation which implies less free manoevering 
2018-10-02 12:10:18	+eyeoh	[05:57:00] yeah blunders sting a lot more

2018-10-03 21:12:40	***	Buffer Playback...
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[01:33:18] I had a look at the top 100 FIDE players and it's surprising how few of the names I recognize
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[01:33:22] What I take away from that is: work hard, play and study every day, and you too can be somebody that nobody's ever heard of but at least your name will be high on some list nobody reads.
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[01:34:12] The list, BTW: https://ratings.fide.com/top.phtml
2018-10-03 21:12:40	whomsoever	[02:22:55] have you checked the list that includes the inactive players, like Kasparov?
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[02:23:59] Dunno why that really matters
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[02:26:51] Kasparov would probably be near the bottom of the list if he started playing again today
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[02:27:05] He's gone too long without playing and he's getting up there in years
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[02:27:41] He'd be able to work his way back up it if he really wanted to, probably
2018-10-03 21:12:40	furrykef	[02:27:59] But he would never be #1 again
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:19:46] Interesting discussion.
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:20:25] First, quora is not very good. But I guess the question is vaguely legitimate - other chess people probably want to know if they'll pull the opposite sex
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:21:01] As for chess as a career - it's really got to start from childhood
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:21:51] And speculating about kasparov being ranked again is like pondering about Rod Laver (tennis) playing Roger Federer nos
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:21:55] Now*
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:22:24] Advanced chess has a lot of memorisation right? It's a bit like memorising cards almost - practise matters
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:23:22] I haven't checked FIDE but some ranking lists allow players to remove themselves so they don't face a drop after retirement
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:23:43] It's meaningless to still be ranked while not accumulating points
2018-10-03 21:12:40	+eyeoh	[07:23:53] Think Serena Williams
2018-10-03 21:12:40	prsstnt	[07:24:45] the african war lord of tennis
2018-10-03 21:12:41	prsstnt	[07:24:51] lordette
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[07:38:12] If you say so
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[08:45:56] Just tested power board mains active to earth without tripping the RCD this time yay
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[08:51:25] That curiosity has been sated enough now. Time to cycle outside, possibly some roads (but mostly not)
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[09:54:19] Damn, without drawing that 2470 player in the first round, Caruana would be nr 1 already
2018-10-03 21:12:41	prsstnt	[10:22:58] i wonder if any of these top players can beat the chess ai ever
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+tobiasvl	[10:28:32] eyeoh: "A player is considered to commence inactivity if he plays no rated games in a one year period."

2018-10-03 21:12:41	qed	[10:30:49] prsstnt, chess engines are significantly better than top human players, it's no contest
2018-10-03 21:12:41	prsstnt	[10:34:45] a new game should be made based on whatever the chess ai is able to master thathumans cannot, so that humans can reason at a higher level
2018-10-03 21:12:41	prsstnt	[10:35:23] it's basically able to see how it can guarentee a victory ~20 moves into the future right?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	prsstnt	[10:35:59] i wonder if there is a higher level of logic that needs to be discovered to allow humans to compete

2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:42:38] hello
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:42:39] https://lichess.org/4d4tRImxTCng
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:42:45] there has been a big bug on lichess
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:42:49] my pawn do c
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:42:56] do c5 and then capture xc6
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:43:15] it's called en passant
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:43:36] how can it be captured on c6 when my pawn is on c5 ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:43:39] if you move your pawn two squares, the opponent can capture it as if you only moved it one, but he has to do it on the next turn
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:43:46] it's a rule :P
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:43:48] really ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:43:53] didn't knew of this rul
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:43:58] never learnt it
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:44:54] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZKl-uhnAeI
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:45:25] (the person explaining it is right, the software doesn't have the rule correctly implemented)
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[12:46:51] I thought I was knowing the rules
2018-10-03 21:12:41	emajor	[12:47:07] im a newbie, like around 1200.. anyone wanna play 10 0 with me? unrated @ lichess
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[12:48:39] bbear: this is one of the least known rules, many people who don't play regularly are unfamiliar with it
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:01:19] what is the least known rule ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:12:51] draw by repetition? the exact rules when castling is legal? 50 move draws?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:13:17] Seirawan doesn't seem to be aware touch move is also a rule :P
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:20:50] draw by repetition I know it
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:21:15] castling is legal provided neither the rook nor the king has moved previously and neither the rook nor the king is in check by another piece.
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:21:22] 50 move draws, I don't know this one.
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:23:15] jmaister: for the soldering iron sponge
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:25:58] bbear: and the king can't be in check and the end, nor move through an attacked square. the rook can, though
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:26:17] bbear: 50 moves without pawn move or capture -> draw
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:26:44] bbear: the rook can be attacked when you castle, that's fine
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:27:06] allright
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:27:45] Garf: you mean none of the three squares where the king is moving can be attacked ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	bbear	[13:27:49] didn't know it.
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:28:05] right
2018-10-03 21:12:41	Garf	[13:28:32] There's a famous instance of a GM calling the arbiter because he wasn't sure about it. Hence: not exactly the most well known rule.
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:36:51] I was pretty sure that castling is allowed so long as the king never crosses into check
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:37:46] I guess a GM might not know because it's not a frequent occurrence and it's more a thing that only newbies drill on
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:38:08] I remember in primary school, some kids thought that castline was literally swapping the king and rock around
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:38:32] thank goodness I could read books
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:39:00] as for draw by repetition, I think it's a repetition of the board - so if you remember the same position repeating 3 times, you call a draw
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:39:07] it doesn't need to be consecutive
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:39:53] on the topic of grinds: https://chess.stackexchange.com/questions/8982/theoretical-limit-for-the-number-of-consecutive-checks
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+eyeoh	[13:40:11] I think another kid made up a rule about consecutive check leading to draw too

2018-10-03 21:12:41	+JimmyRustles	[19:09:43] but i definitely know what move i shouldn't make
2018-10-03 21:12:41	+JimmyRustles	[19:09:51] because it looks like a decent king move but turns into a mate in 3 against me
2018-10-03 21:12:41	xcombelle	[19:12:59] which game JimmyRustles ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	xcombelle	[19:18:39] on https://lichess.org/tv there is previously on lichess tv is it new ?
2018-10-03 21:12:41	artefact	[19:19:08] ”previously on” means it's not new, no
2018-10-03 21:12:41	xcombelle	[19:23:50] artefact I mean the "previously on" function is a new function of lichess ?

2018-10-04 13:37:29	flapz	[04:37:18] You will play 20,000 games against Magnus. If you win 1 game you get 1 Billion Dollars, if Magnus draws or wins all games you get taken out back and shot. Would you take the gamble?
2018-10-04 13:37:29	ShiroiAkuma	[04:37:43] yes
2018-10-04 13:37:29	ShiroiAkuma	[04:37:55] 20k is enough to get me killed :D
2018-10-04 13:37:29	flapz	[04:38:11] lol
2018-10-04 13:37:29	flapz	[04:40:21] I would also take the bet, but I would immediately resign 19,999 games just to make it interesting 
2018-10-04 13:37:29	ShiroiAkuma	[04:41:30] lol hahahahahhahahha thats pretty evilish
2018-10-04 13:37:29	ShiroiAkuma	[04:41:48] and I think after 1000 games we will start seeing certain pattern in magnus's games
2018-10-04 13:37:29	ShiroiAkuma	[04:42:04] something like weakness or maybe his very strong points
2018-10-04 13:37:29	qed-office	[06:48:00] good morning respectable chess player
2018-10-04 13:37:29	qed-office	[06:48:01] s
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[08:34:52] Playing 20,000 games against Magnus sounds worse than being shot
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[08:35:08] An infinite number of monkeys cannot type up Shakespeare
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[08:35:19] Probability doesn't work like that
2018-10-04 13:37:29	Garf	[08:50:45] lost again OTB
2018-10-04 13:37:29	Garf	[08:50:49] jeez
2018-10-04 13:37:29	Garf	[08:50:57] this one will cost actual rating points...a ton too
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[09:04:15] You have to sit still and think very hard
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[09:04:21] The Richard Feynman method
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[09:05:09] http://wiki.c2.com/?FeynmanAlgorithm
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[09:05:48] Wow Gell-Mann came to with it
2018-10-04 13:37:29	+eyeoh	[09:06:07] I need to learn more about him
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[10:27:28] Gell-Mann didn't like Feynman too much, at least as a person, though of course he respected Feynman's work
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[10:28:23] He pretty much saw him as a know-it-all who liked to fabricate stories about himself
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[10:29:28] My interpretation of Feynman is he was probably honest most of the time (sometimes too honest, even) but his memory of things doesn't necessarily match how they actually happened
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[10:30:26] That happens to everyone, though
2018-10-04 13:37:29	qed-office	[10:46:33] how are you today furrykef ?
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:01:37] I am as I am
2018-10-04 13:37:29	mursu	[11:08:24] that sounds like a very german answer
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:11:32] Ich bin wie ich bin.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:21:05] Hi. I'm searching for some platform or app that would help me teach my son openings. But in a systematic way. I looked at leeches where I tried to create study with specific openings and then split lines over chapters. 
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:21:21] One would have to guess the best/correct moves on lines.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:22:02] tiny: try chessable.com. They've got some free books you can use, and you can even create a few of your own
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:22:07] I'd prefer if one could study with an app or if no app trough web interface. Device is ipad.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:22:21] No idea what their iPad support is like. I don't use mobile.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:22:38] It's really practical for a 7 year old.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:25:46] furrykef:  chessable has courses from known books adopted for online learning?
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:26:09] yeah
2018-10-04 13:37:29	furrykef	[11:26:29] Most of them are opening books but there are a couple of endgame and middlegame books
2018-10-04 13:37:29	tiny	[11:29:02] wow, dvoretsky endgame
2018-10-04 13:37:29	Garf	[11:32:29] I use chessable on tablets all the time
2018-10-04 13:37:29	drakan	[13:15:51] I like lichess on mobile a lot but I’ll have to try chessable
2018-10-04 13:37:29	drakan	[13:16:06] The studies on lichess are pretty hit or miss
2018-10-04 13:37:29	penthief	[13:26:18] tiny: Opening trainer on chesstempo.com is an option. I have just tried it on iPad Safari & it works well. Mind you, some features require registration, & I don't recall if Opening Trainer is one of them.
2018-10-04 13:37:29	penthief	[13:27:38] "Registration and use of the chess opening trainer are both free." according to https://beta.chesstempo.com/opening-training/
2018-10-04 13:37:29	penthief	[13:31:42] I find it particularly useful, because if I play a game on CT which contains an opening line not covered in my opening repetoires, I get a notification to add the moves to my opening tree.

2018-10-04 16:52:01	penthief	Yes, if you set the chapter's "analysis mode" to "interactive lesson". Then hit "preview" to try it out.
2018-10-04 16:52:44	penthief	It could be made easier to find, and use.

2018-10-04 19:32:20	+tiny	https://lichess.org/study/Z6pKyOao  <-- do you see the moves on chapter 8
2018-10-04 19:32:42	+Momentum	nope
2018-10-04 19:33:10	+Momentum	yes you could see the moves actually because i added you as a contributer
2018-10-04 19:33:25	+Momentum	or a member i still don't understand how this thing work anyway
2018-10-04 19:33:55	+Momentum	you should not be able to see the moves in my study now
2018-10-04 19:34:17	+tiny	ok let me check. I added you to my as a viewer. Can you check again?
2018-10-04 19:34:59	+tiny	Momentum: still seeing all the moves
2018-10-04 19:35:29	+tiny	oh yeah .. also when you play, computer doesn't play anymore.
2018-10-04 19:36:10	+Momentum	i don't think that's how this analysis mode is supposed to work
2018-10-04 19:36:17	+Momentum	that should be interactive lesson instead
2018-10-04 19:36:35	+Momentum	or practice with computer if all you care about is SF
2018-10-04 19:36:38	+tiny	well ... i tried them all
2018-10-04 19:36:43	+tiny	hehe
2018-10-04 19:36:58	+Momentum	i don't know then
2018-10-04 19:37:18	+Momentum	well your study is working fine
2018-10-04 19:37:28	+Momentum	i can play against computer i guess
2018-10-04 19:38:13	+Momentum	also that's a draw so :P
2018-10-04 19:38:41	+eyeoh	I keep forgetting what sf is
2018-10-04 19:38:55	+eyeoh	I only see san francisco

2018-10-04 19:39:51	+eyeoh	like golly, even if I played as strongly as fritz...
2018-10-04 19:40:42	+eyeoh	I do the puzzles, then question the solutions - then I step back and run stockfish at nerfed level; then I see "ah ok, fair enough you win"
2018-10-04 19:40:49	+eyeoh	every. time.
2018-10-04 19:41:19	+eyeoh	at my level I think the trickiest thing is identifying how deep I need to try to think
2018-10-04 19:41:32	+eyeoh	whether it's something superficial like undefended pieces, or if there's a more clever play ahead
2018-10-04 19:41:37	+eyeoh	that in itself takes time to figure out
2018-10-04 19:42:00	+eyeoh	obviously I need to develop my skill at recognising the easy quickly
2018-10-04 19:42:26	+eyeoh	in desktop mode, you get a vague indication of puzzle difficulty by seeing the player ratings and game type
2018-10-04 19:42:42	+eyeoh	but really in real life you don't get that very often
2018-10-04 19:42:51	+eyeoh	you only get the position and cards you're dealt with and deal with it
2018-10-04 19:42:58	+Momentum	you could also just turn the hell out of SF and enjoy chess as pure mind challenge
2018-10-04 19:43:20	+eyeoh	I sometimes do that too
2018-10-04 19:43:24	+eyeoh	variety is the spice
2018-10-04 19:43:54	+eyeoh	most of the time I don't look at its recommendations; I only do it to understand why if I'm baffled
2018-10-04 19:44:23	+Momentum	it's hard to understand why an engine suggests a move not another
2018-10-04 19:44:28	+Momentum	very hard

2018-10-04 20:23:22	+eyeoh	the engine will always beat you

2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:19:51] chess engines are absolutely not depth-first
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:19:58] they would be pretty stupid if they were
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:20:35] i just got told "Fica de esmola" and google translate isn't helping me out.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:20:36] “what do i play, engine?” (5 centuries later) “hang on bro, still analysing 1. e3 e6 2. b3”
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:22:20] Anyone know what was meant?
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:22:26] It could be important.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:22:35] sounds like an insult
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:22:43] son of something
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:22:44] nah
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:22:57] oh, ok
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:23:19] but i'm really not sure.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:23:23] gun? son of a gun?
2018-10-04 22:47:36	+eyeoh	[21:24:44] where did you get told?
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:25:42] chess tempo
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:50:06] what's another good chess site besides lichess? not chess.com
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:50:21] yahoo! chess
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:50:27] i wish yahoo chess was still around
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:50:45] i feel angry today so im going to avoid lichess since i don't want to risk being banned again.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:51:16] strategies.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:51:31] I've already said chesstempo 5 times today, so I can't suggest it again.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:51:40] that's a tactics trainer tho
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:51:44] i use that 
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:51:53] or it has an online mode now?
2018-10-04 22:47:36	artefact	[21:51:55] ...
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:52:02] mmhm
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:52:03] what, am i missing out on something
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:52:09] really hmm let me check
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:52:42] there are like 3-4 games 
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:52:43] lol
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:53:40] i usually just play one
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:53:58] i'm annexation.
2018-10-04 22:47:36	ghostdude	[21:54:03] im playing now
2018-10-04 22:47:36	penthief	[21:54:04] i think momentum said he has two account so he can play himself
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[21:56:24] honestly, lichess is the best site to play
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[21:57:18] since the CEO himself unbanned me recently, makes me want to avoid trashing it at any cost. 
2018-10-04 22:47:37	flapz	[22:00:43] well, chess.com is the best of course, but w/e 
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:01:07] maybe for others, for me, the site feels sluggish
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:02:18] esp for bullet games. pieces just feels slow
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:04:38] chesstempo is pretty good
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:05:08] it has that slick & smooth feeling like lichess which i really like
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:12:39] Is ICC chess still good?

2018-10-04 22:47:37	+eyeoh	[22:18:25] maybe you need a doc
2018-10-04 22:47:37	+eyeoh	[22:18:46] your choice though
2018-10-04 22:47:37	ghostdude	[22:19:18] seeing a doctor is a weakness

2018-10-05 02:28:48	furrykef	The vast majority of chess engines use a depth-first search with iterative deepening and heavy pruning
2018-10-05 02:29:16	furrykef	Iterative deepening makes it behave closer to a breadth-first search
2018-10-05 02:29:28	+Momentum	20:11:07 +Momentum | chess engines are depth-first, humans are pattern-first
2018-10-05 02:29:31	furrykef	ah
2018-10-05 02:29:42	+Momentum	22:47:36  artefact | [21:19:51] chess engines are absolutely not depth-first
2018-10-05 02:30:06	+Momentum	i don't know what he meant by that anyway
2018-10-05 02:30:36	+Momentum	22:47:36  artefact | [21:19:58] they would be pretty stupid if they were
2018-10-05 02:30:47	furrykef	I'm guessing he was referring to how iterative deepening and the various extensions and reductions mean that a chess engine's search doesn't really behave much like a pure depth-first search.
2018-10-05 02:31:31	furrykef	An engine with a pure depth-first search would indeed be pretty stupid
2018-10-05 02:31:35	+Momentum	iterative deepening is just a framework, the backbone is obviously DFS
2018-10-05 02:32:19	+Momentum	i'm not saying and engine is just DFS surely
2018-10-05 02:34:04	furrykef	I think artefact's point was characterizing an engine's search as "depth-first" is inaccurate, which I think is fair.
2018-10-05 02:34:19	furrykef	The way it searches the nodes in the tree is much more like breadth-first

2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:24:50] umph i'd say more like breadth first.  you generate all the moves from a node, order them best-first (by your best guess), then at the next level generate the opponent's moves best-first so you can do beta cutoffs at the next level etc
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:33:39] does human vs human top level chess have a future?
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:33:56] One wonders if it has much of a present :P
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:34:03] :)
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:34:05] Only chess nerds really care about it
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:34:55] yeah maybe the public cared about it more in the kasparov era
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:35:16] I think Fischer vs. Spassky was the last match the world really cared about. The '75 one, not the '92 one.
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:35:35] yeah
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:35:37] 72
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:35:46] Er, yeah, '72
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:35:59] but now, i mean, they're trying to package it as being like golf or something and it looks ridiculous
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:36:51] i liked how someone said FIDE is like FIFA except lop off a few zeros
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:43:21] but i mean, i followed CCCC on and off, and i'm like, this is a pretty good tournament, why would i want to follow human tournaments full of those prima donnas any more?  
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:50:20] wow lc0 beats sf9 15.5-8.5 (+7 =17 -0) in ltc match
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:50:53] I've never followed chess tournaments in the first place.
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:51:06] It's not like I can understand chess at that level.
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:51:48] It's like watching hockey with a puck that only the players can see
2018-10-05 11:50:43	furrykef	[05:52:09] And you don't even have a home team to cheer for
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[05:52:45] heh yeah
2018-10-05 11:50:43	ghostdude	[07:19:10] lichess runs so good on linux
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:21:32] how do you edit PGN tags in a lichess study?
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:21:43] furrykef: it's very understandable if they have live comments
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:23:24] all modern a/b engines are depth first
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:23:46] mcts engines are best first
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:23:56] although there are formulations of mcts so it can work depth first too
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:24:23] depth first vs best first is the way of implementing the algorithm, it has no bearing on what the search actually does
2018-10-05 11:50:43	artefact	[08:24:34] excuse me what the fuck
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:24:35] see Aske Plaat, Research Re: search & research, 1996
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:25:22] (which rewrites several best first algorithms as successive depth-first a/b calls)
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:27:03] nobody says a depth-first call can't modify the depth during the recursive call, which is of course what all implementations actually do
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:27:33] the difference is the necessity of keeping the entire tree in memory (which best-first pretty much requires), versus only requiring a stack of the size of the maximal depth
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[08:31:51] if you wonder how the 1996 article can have achieved the equivalence then, it works under the assumption of sufficiently large transposition tables, which is of course the same as keeping the entire tree in memory
2018-10-05 11:50:43	ShiroiAkuma	[08:32:20] sounds memory consuming :/

2018-10-05 11:50:43	izabera	[09:18:35] https://i.imgur.com/pr6jWSF.png     mmmmmh 
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:19:16] garf alpha-beta works much better with best-first ordering so AB engines try rather hard to arrange for that
2018-10-05 11:50:43	izabera	[09:19:38] do i have to use the same one they played in the actual game or...?
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:19:55] solrize: the ordering has nothing to do with how the search algorithm is laid out
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:20:04] solrize: it's still depth-first even if you put the best move first
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:20:25] i mean you get more cutoffs when you look at the best moves first
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:20:30] because you explore (even if that means just cutting) all moves at any given ply
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:21:16] the ordering is just there to get a better performance in alpha beta
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:21:29] it doesn't change anything about whether your implementation is depth first or best first
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:21:41] right
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:21:50] basically, you terminate the search when you reach the given goal depth (which can be modified on the fly)
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:21:52] but, practical implementations care about performance :)
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:22:14] they do, but it's completely irrelevant for difference between the algorithmic structures
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:22:18] it's like saying you want a good eval
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:22:21] I mean, sure, but
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:22:45] whereas in a best-first search, you terminate when you reach the best-node
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:22:56] by whatever definition your algorithm applies
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:23:11] conceptually, best-first will restart every search call at the root
2018-10-05 11:50:43	Garf	[09:23:27] whereas depth first will just back up one level
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:24:07] hm ok
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:24:43] thanks (and i gotta go to bed shortly)

2018-10-05 11:50:43	ghostdude	[09:35:05] you emailed the actual tao and he responded?
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:37:47] yeah, there was an error on one of his web pages (nothing too serious) and he fixed it and thanked me
2018-10-05 11:50:43	solrize	[09:38:07] he responds to comments on his blog too

2018-10-05 14:42:56	qed	furrykef, looks nice
2018-10-05 14:43:18	furrykef	Heh, I didn't draw it or anythin'
2018-10-05 14:52:56	furrykef	My drawing skills are about on par with my chess skills. Make of that what you will.
2018-10-05 14:57:43	furrykef	Hmm... I have a math notation issue. I want to take a derivative where the value of x is known and I'm not sure how to notate it. Like I have d/dx where x is 11
2018-10-05 14:58:11	artefact	d/dx(f(x))|_{x=11}
2018-10-05 14:58:17	artefact	or f'(11) if it's just one variable
2018-10-05 14:58:42	furrykef	I already have f'(11)... I want to expand it in-place
2018-10-05 14:59:50	+Momentum	do you have f'?
2018-10-05 14:59:57	furrykef	yes
2018-10-05 15:00:10	+Momentum	put 11 where you see x then
2018-10-05 15:01:32	furrykef	I know the procedure, this is a question of notation. If I have d/dx x^3 I can't replace it with d/dx 11^3 because the derivative of 11^3 is 0. It should be 3x^2 = 1089.
2018-10-05 15:01:59	furrykef	artefact: I need to know how to write it in proper notation, not ASCII notation, I'm afraid
2018-10-05 15:02:33	+Momentum	what's d/dx 11^3 that's not your function or is it?
2018-10-05 15:03:02	furrykef	Let's suppose for our purposes f(x) is x^3
2018-10-05 15:03:19	+Momentum	your function is x^3 its deravative is d/dx x^3
2018-10-05 15:03:19	furrykef	So I want to know how I would expand f'(11)
2018-10-05 15:03:22	artefact	http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdfrac%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7Dx%7D%5Cleft.%5Cleft%28%20x%5E3%20%5Cright%20%29%20%5Cright%7C_%7Bx%3D11%7D%20%3D%203%20%5Ccdot%2011%5E2%20%3D%20363
2018-10-05 15:03:46	furrykef	Yes, and d/dx x^3 = 3x^2
2018-10-05 15:03:55	furrykef	d/dx 11^3 = 0
2018-10-05 15:04:27	+Momentum	so f'(11) = (3(11))^2
2018-10-05 15:04:43	+Momentum	or wait a second 3x^2?
2018-10-05 15:04:48	furrykef	artefact: that GIF isn't too readable on my browser but I think I understand
2018-10-05 15:04:54	+Momentum	my maaaaath
2018-10-05 15:05:12	furrykef	Momentum: I want to write it with d/dx notation
2018-10-05 15:05:25	+Momentum	hmm
2018-10-05 15:05:58	furrykef	Now if only I can figure out how to type the notatino artefact gave into Math-o-mir
2018-10-05 15:06:09	furrykef	*notation
2018-10-05 15:06:16	furrykef	(thanks, BTW)
2018-10-05 15:06:29	+Momentum	try it on latex
2018-10-05 15:06:44	furrykef	I don't use Latex for solving math problems
2018-10-05 15:06:53	+Momentum	latex is not for solving math problems
2018-10-05 15:07:06	furrykef	Well, solving math problems is what I'm doing.
2018-10-05 15:07:43	+Momentum	i don't think so :P
2018-10-05 15:07:49	furrykef	???
2018-10-05 15:07:52	furrykef	I would know what I'm doing
2018-10-05 15:07:54	+Momentum	notation is what you were trying to do
2018-10-05 15:08:10	furrykef	You use math notation when solving math problems
2018-10-05 15:08:14	+Momentum	at least that was your question
2018-10-05 15:08:23	furrykef	yes, I want to know how to write the operation I'm doing
2018-10-05 15:09:13	+Momentum	so try the notation artefact gave you on an online latex editor and look at it
2018-10-05 15:09:44	furrykef	I don't need to do that, I already know what it's supposed to look like now
2018-10-05 15:09:55	+Momentum	alright then
2018-10-05 15:09:56	furrykef	I need to type it into Math-o-mir so I can actually *use* it
2018-10-05 15:10:30	+Momentum	good luck i have no idea what that is
2018-10-05 15:11:18	furrykef	It's a program for typing in math formulae
2018-10-05 15:11:25	furrykef	Basically a mathematical scratch pad
2018-10-05 15:11:33	furrykef	I don't like it much but it's the best one I've found so far.
2018-10-05 15:12:06	artefact	have you tried maxima/sage/octave/xcas etc?
2018-10-05 15:12:43	furrykef	nope
2018-10-05 15:13:11	furrykef	Do any of those have a scratchpad mode? Where I just type in formulae and it doesn't try to actually perform any operations?
2018-10-05 15:14:49	+Momentum	octave looks good, but mathematica is great in terms of non-free software
2018-10-05 15:15:21	furrykef	Mathematica is too expensive and I'm not gonna pirate it
2018-10-05 15:15:35	+Momentum	i think those softwares are meant to calculate anyway
2018-10-05 15:15:42	artefact	i've always used maxima. we used it at school, i used it for the teacher exam, i still use it today
2018-10-05 15:16:00	artefact	it's capable, albeit somewhat arcane

2018-10-05 15:17:33	furrykef	Maxima doesn't seem to be the kind of thing I'm looking for
2018-10-05 15:17:42	furrykef	I'm looking for something that's just like doing math with pencil and paper
2018-10-05 15:17:52	artefact	here's an idea, then. pencil and paper.
2018-10-05 15:17:58	furrykef	I could of course just use pencil and paper but it's more tedious than using Math-o-mir
2018-10-05 15:18:14	furrykef	I like having everything up there together on the screen, and not wasting paper or everything
2018-10-05 15:18:20	furrykef	Plus typing is faster than writing
2018-10-05 15:18:25	furrykef	*or anything
2018-10-05 15:18:26	artefact	(X) doubt
2018-10-05 15:19:00	furrykef	I always hated doing math with pencil and paper because it didn't take too long for my wrist to start hurting...
2018-10-05 15:21:21	+Momentum	why not latex again?
2018-10-05 15:21:48	+eyeoh	do you have a standard pencil holding grip furrykef?
2018-10-05 15:21:54	furrykef	Because typing Latex is not at all like using pencil and paper?
2018-10-05 15:22:02	+eyeoh	or is your pencil hold a bit of a fist?
2018-10-05 15:22:20	furrykef	tbh telling me to use pencil and paper is like saying "If you don't like your word processor why don't you just use pencil and paper to write your novel?" Because using pencil and paper sucks, that's why.
2018-10-05 15:22:25	+Momentum	so you want pencil and paper on a computer a screen? hmm
2018-10-05 15:22:33	furrykef	I think my grip is standard
2018-10-05 15:22:47	furrykef	Here, let me show you what doing math in Math-o-mir looks like
2018-10-05 15:22:49	+eyeoh	I used to hold it poorly
2018-10-05 15:22:59	+eyeoh	then I had to learn to write faster, and fix my grip
2018-10-05 15:24:33	furrykef	I still vaguely remember struggling with learning to write. For a while I couldn't even figure out which hand was better to write with.
2018-10-05 15:24:40	furrykef	Now I'm embarrassingly right-handed.
2018-10-05 15:27:07	furrykef	http://bucket.furrykef.com:9000/doing-math.png  hopefully this will transfer fast enough over my lousy-ass internet
2018-10-05 15:27:15	furrykef	(my upload speed sucks)
2018-10-05 15:28:00	furrykef	As you can see, the Math-o-mir window looks a lot like how you would solve the problem with pencil and paper
2018-10-05 15:28:51	furrykef	And you can see the part I was talking about, with the d/dx... I wanted to show that x=2
2018-10-05 15:28:58	+Momentum	MFW png
2018-10-05 15:29:39	furrykef	what's wrong with PNG?
2018-10-05 15:31:19	+Momentum	i would never solve math this way in my life, but if i happened to by silly and did it i will use latex
2018-10-05 15:31:29	+Momentum	s/by/be
2018-10-05 15:31:33	furrykef	well, you're not me and I'm not you
2018-10-05 15:31:39	furrykef	This is how I like to do it
2018-10-05 15:32:26	+eyeoh	I often type with just my right hand cause I'm fooding with my left
2018-10-05 15:32:42	+eyeoh	it makes little sense to eat finger food with right hand in case of handshake
2018-10-05 15:33:47	+Momentum	in my religion, you wash your dirt with the left hand and do the good deeds with the right one
2018-10-05 15:33:50	+Momentum	:P
2018-10-05 15:35:15	+eyeoh	what if I clean stuff with my right? :)
2018-10-05 15:35:23	+Momentum	you go to hell
2018-10-05 15:35:35	+eyeoh	I have no religion but we don't have to discuss that
2018-10-05 15:35:40	+Momentum	i mean that's the worse case scenario
2018-10-05 15:35:41	furrykef	Your god isn't very nice. I don't think I'll worship him.
2018-10-05 15:35:52	+eyeoh	yeah I'm not into pascal's wager
2018-10-05 15:36:04	 *	eyeoh not afraid
2018-10-05 15:36:29	+Momentum	my god knows what's nice anyway, it's not you who decide
2018-10-05 15:36:47	+Momentum	unless you're a god yourself which apparently is not
2018-10-05 15:37:02	+Momentum	since there's only one god
2018-10-05 15:37:41	qed	I'm scared of π 
2018-10-05 15:37:42	qed	It's an irrational fear
2018-10-05 15:37:43	furrykef	One more than I believe in, but meh
2018-10-05 15:37:49	furrykef	qed: groan
2018-10-05 15:40:56	furrykef	I hate when I get weird numbers when solving a problem... makes me wonder if I'm doing it right... I got 128/211 as the solution to this problem I just did
2018-10-05 15:41:24	drakan	man the UI for lichess is so sick ... when you jump ahead a bunch of moves and the pieces just transition
2018-10-05 15:41:26	furrykef	Oh, pfft. Yeah, definitely wrong
2018-10-05 15:41:29	 *	furrykef redoes a bunch of stuff
2018-10-05 15:41:34	+Momentum	the good thing about religion, is that you stick to something and if it's not true you won't lose anything, unlike athiesm which will always be risky except when physicists are correct about the universe
2018-10-05 15:41:37	furrykef	drakan: yeah, it's nice
2018-10-05 15:42:19	drakan	Momentum: it is also risky to choose the "wrong" religion, in the case where one religion is correct but it's not the one you selected
2018-10-05 15:42:20	artefact	you can also just use (x³+2x-1)' instead of d/dx
2018-10-05 15:42:33	artefact	if there's only one unknown, and if you're not a physicist, you'll be ok with it
2018-10-05 15:42:47	+Momentum	that too drakan, if you're christian and it turns out it's about islam you RIP
2018-10-05 15:43:16	drakan	i dunno, judeo / christian / muslim seems to overlap enough that you're pretty safe picking any of them
2018-10-05 15:43:24	drakan	but if like roko's basilisk is true? gg
2018-10-05 15:44:01	+Momentum	bhudaism is a bit off too
2018-10-05 15:44:36	furrykef	Pfft. Now that I did the problem properly, the solution is 1/2
2018-10-05 15:44:52	+Momentum	that sounds more like a correct answer to a problem
2018-10-05 15:45:04	furrykef	Sometimes though weird numbers are the right answer
2018-10-05 15:45:08	+Momentum	regardless of the problem itself
2018-10-05 15:45:37	+Momentum	never get tricked unless you're doing physics, weird number can arise outta nowhere
2018-10-05 15:47:23	+Momentum	another common derivative is the \dot{x} to refer to derivative with respect to time
2018-10-05 15:47:40	+Momentum	that is d/dt x

2018-10-05 16:58:14	artefact	also, spoiling something that's just a formula you're supposed to know
2018-10-05 16:59:11	artefact	iirc the proof uses (f⁻¹' = 1/f'of⁻¹
2018-10-05 17:00:22	furrykef	I'm not sure I'm supposed to just know it yet
2018-10-05 17:01:39	furrykef	Heh... so I solved it (solution was 2/53... talk about a weird number) and I asked it to show the process... and it did indeed just use that formula >.>
2018-10-05 17:02:13	furrykef	Correction, -2/53

2018-10-05 17:08:07	+eyeoh	lol Momentum I've been having a bad run
2018-10-05 17:08:23	+eyeoh	I thought people said lichess glicko2 was inflated
2018-10-05 17:08:31	+eyeoh	i.e. 1500 = 1200 or so
2018-10-05 17:08:39	+eyeoh	either way I'm tanking
2018-10-05 17:08:55	furrykef	You really can't compare rating pools like that.
2018-10-05 17:09:00	+eyeoh	I know
2018-10-05 17:09:02	+eyeoh	it's ok, relax
2018-10-05 17:09:14	+eyeoh	and by 1200 I'm referring to chess.com of course
2018-10-05 17:09:19	+eyeoh	there are faqs of sorts on this

2018-10-05 17:09:37	+eyeoh	comparing lichess to chess.com is normal

2018-10-05 17:12:05	+eyeoh	well this one covers only chess.com and FIDE: https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/fide-ratings-vs-chesscom-ratings-explored
2018-10-05 17:12:39	+eyeoh	and then there's anecdata comparing lichess to chess.com - this is the best I can do: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lichess+chess.com+glicko+elo+rating&bext=msl&atb=v104-4&ia=web
2018-10-05 17:13:11	+eyeoh	the apparently existing 'verdict' is that lichess is 'inflated'
2018-10-05 17:13:30	penthief	thanks. the 1st link looks especially interesting
2018-10-05 17:13:32	+eyeoh	I don't think anyone has researched it properly yet
2018-10-05 17:13:46	+eyeoh	I certainly haven't played on chess.com much at all to compare
2018-10-05 17:14:15	+eyeoh	so yeah, interesting that Momentum alleges that lichess 1500s feel like 2400s
2018-10-05 17:14:42	artefact	or maybe they're a 1500? and cheating
2018-10-05 17:14:46	+eyeoh	I have absolutely no idea right now where I'll end up in another 10-50 games
2018-10-05 17:14:52	+eyeoh	or new? *shrug*
2018-10-05 17:14:58	+eyeoh	actually there are heaps who aren't new
2018-10-05 17:15:10	+eyeoh	and they're just annihilating me - so it's either that or I'm blundering more lately
2018-10-05 17:15:30	+eyeoh	people who have played hundreds of games of just one type
2018-10-05 17:15:42	+eyeoh	hmm that in itself seems odd - no puzzles for some
2018-10-05 17:16:28	+eyeoh	(for the record, I'm definitely blundering as always)
2018-10-05 17:16:57	penthief	A user's puzzle rating doesn't say much. They covered this on r/anarchychess.

2018-10-05 17:17:12	+eyeoh	but I mean they have 0 puzzles done
2018-10-05 17:17:18	+eyeoh	it's like they're not real accounts
2018-10-05 17:17:28	+eyeoh	only playing rapid and nothing else
2018-10-05 17:17:30	artefact	i think you're being presumptuous
2018-10-05 17:17:36	+eyeoh	how?
2018-10-05 17:17:40	artefact	many ppl have many accounts, or are just interested in one thing
2018-10-05 17:17:41	+eyeoh	it just seems odd; that's fact
2018-10-05 17:17:56	artefact	there's plenty of other places, besides lichess, to do tactics. or maybe they don't
2018-10-05 17:17:57	+eyeoh	yeah I find that odd
2018-10-05 17:17:57	penthief	not that odd. some users have 0 forum posts.
2018-10-05 17:18:08	+eyeoh	but not even one puzzle to see what it's like
2018-10-05 17:18:35	artefact	did you read the “many accounts” part?
2018-10-05 17:18:38	+eyeoh	yet they hammer the rapid games and nothing else, hundreds of them - and have a rating below 1500 but have been smashing me when earlier 1500 didn't feel that way
2018-10-05 17:18:48	+eyeoh	yeah many accounts is kind of suss
2018-10-05 17:18:54	+Momentum	i mean what the hell is this https://lichess.org/4GYxZEdeJXkU
2018-10-05 17:19:03	+eyeoh	so as I repeat, either I'm blundering more lately, or it's odd
2018-10-05 17:19:18	+eyeoh	I'm still not really sure which - any ideas?
2018-10-05 17:19:44	artefact	many accounts isn't suspicious
2018-10-05 17:20:00	+eyeoh	Momentum: but yeah basically I'm somewhat in agreement with you - the 1500s are feeling really tough atm
2018-10-05 17:20:05	artefact	if i play on a tablet, then of course i will use a different account. just in case it gets stolen and i don't want the real credentials in the wild
2018-10-05 17:20:27	penthief	3+0 christ that's a quick game.
2018-10-05 17:20:38	furrykef	<Jesus> I know, right?
2018-10-05 17:20:54	artefact	played a 5+0 tournament yesterday evening, in a pub

2018-10-05 17:21:17	+eyeoh	penthief: have you watched the 30 second hyperbullet games on youtube?

2018-10-05 17:31:07	+Momentum	it's quite safer to play a 1600
2018-10-05 17:31:41	+eyeoh	no expectations playing a higher rated player
2018-10-05 17:32:33	+eyeoh	actually I think I've been botching my opening lately
2018-10-05 17:32:53	penthief	Playing on a Friday night seems to help your rating. More games against alcohol.

2018-10-05 18:02:12	artefact	it's only illegal when you get caught
2018-10-05 18:02:16	+eyeoh	^
2018-10-05 18:02:42	furrykef	In a lot of places it's legal to wager on yourself in a game of skill but not in a game of chance.
2018-10-05 18:03:07	furrykef	Which is a fun issue when it comes to poker, because some consider it a game of skill and some consider it a game of chance.
2018-10-05 18:04:09	+eyeoh	police might like to spend time booking jaywalkers, but they're unlikely going to hunt for illegal gamblers unless there's a bigger fish to fry

2018-10-05 18:05:15	+eyeoh	casinos have poker too but I have no idea if the rules are skewed there
2018-10-05 18:07:12	furrykef	Heh, I used to work on gambling websites for a client and he had this one site about pokies. He concocted this Australian persona and said stuff like "Here in Australia we call them pokies"... I don't know if he ever even set foot on Australia. He's from France, spent a good while in America, and was living in Taiwan (probably still is)
2018-10-05 18:07:31	furrykef	I don't like lying so that kinda made me uncomfortable
2018-10-05 18:08:04	furrykef	I didn't understand why he needed to do that. It's not like he had to be Australian to be a credible source on Australian gambling.
2018-10-05 18:08:12	+eyeoh	interesting
2018-10-05 18:08:24	+eyeoh	Australians are big punters
2018-10-05 18:08:43	+eyeoh	depending on the market, they might be more trustworthy than someone from Taiwan or France
2018-10-05 18:08:48	+eyeoh	where market = australia?

2018-10-05 18:11:06	+eyeoh	heh
2018-10-05 18:11:40	+eyeoh	what amazes me is that making a shit website isn't good enough - people end up making shit *and* slow websites

2018-10-05 18:41:19	+eyeoh	I wonder if it's possible to design a rating system on lichess to closely match fide
2018-10-05 18:41:56	+eyeoh	would probably need some anchor points or something
2018-10-05 18:42:22	furrykef	Considering lichess games aren't played under conditions that are anything close to FIDE games, no.

2018-10-05 18:42:35	+eyeoh	so factor that in too
2018-10-05 18:42:58	+eyeoh	basically, design a system where a fide player switching to lichess ends up, on average with a similar rating; and vice versa
2018-10-05 18:43:04	+eyeoh	impossible?
2018-10-05 18:43:20	+eyeoh	it sounds like an interesting mathematical/algorithm problem to me
2018-10-05 18:43:39	+eyeoh	maybe it needs machine learning :p
2018-10-05 18:44:58	+eyeoh	is this relevant or do I completely not understand what turing complete is? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness
2018-10-05 18:46:16	+eyeoh	There are people who play in FIDE games as well as lichess. They have ratings on both. Therefore there must be some sort of a correlation at some point, on some level between the two ratings.
2018-10-05 18:47:51	+eyeoh	""It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence.

2018-10-05 18:51:45	+eyeoh	in theory, you can match up players from different clubs for a fair contest

2018-10-06 02:15:04	whomsoever	s/move/mode
2018-10-06 02:15:23	ghostdude	yeah man, i don't think i should allow me to chat ever
2018-10-06 02:15:30	ghostdude	myself*
2018-10-06 02:15:56	furrykef	I used to play primarily in Zen mode to hide my opponent's rating, so I won't get overconfident if it's too low or too intimidated if it's too high
2018-10-06 02:16:00	furrykef	But I think I've finally stopped caring
2018-10-06 02:16:17	ghostdude	wait
2018-10-06 02:16:20	whomsoever	to tell ya the truth, above everything I hate is a guy insulting me in the chat box simply 'cause I'm winning
2018-10-06 02:16:24	ghostdude	zen mode? what you talking about
2018-10-06 02:16:29	ghostdude	is that an actual thing in lichess?
2018-10-06 02:16:54	whomsoever	zen mode hides ratings and opponents
2018-10-06 02:17:11	ghostdude	really hm
2018-10-06 02:17:16	whomsoever	so it's pretty much like anonymous 
2018-10-06 02:17:20	ghostdude	where is that option
2018-10-06 02:17:32	whomsoever	and you get to know the rating in the end
2018-10-06 02:17:34	ghostdude	Oh found it
2018-10-06 02:18:54	whomsoever	kind of a great way to avoid having too much pressure like furrykef said, and also to keep your play sharp no matter who you're playing with
2018-10-06 02:19:52	ghostdude	also, i realzie what helps calm me down when im playing blitz is by explaining out loud the moves that im playing. i think that makes me focus more on the game and not my own raw emotions.
2018-10-06 02:20:04	ghostdude	in facti think that's the key
2018-10-06 02:20:22	whomsoever	could be 
2018-10-06 02:20:53	ghostdude	when you explain something or answer a question, it's impossible to do that and be emotional
2018-10-06 02:21:20	ghostdude	but of course not if you're explaining about something emotional. 
2018-10-06 02:22:19	ghostdude	i'm zen af right now. liek this is what i should be everytime i play. and now im going to have dinner, take care

2018-10-06 02:32:14	furrykef	I always give my opponent the benefit of the doubt... I've only had one game in recent memory where I thought my opponent might have cheated
2018-10-06 02:32:40	furrykef	And I shrugged it off in any case since it's not like it really matters to me even if he did (even though I have an extremely low opinion of cheating)
2018-10-06 02:33:20	+Momentum	i gained hundreds of rating points as refunds from lichess against cheaters

2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:45:30] apparently I made a theoretical novelty on move 7
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:45:44] probably not literally but its not in the explorer
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:45:56] bishop g4
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:46:09] which in other lines is a good move but here the engine absolutely hates
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:46:18] and gives a +.8 to white
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:46:26] and a +2.8 after I take the knight
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:47:08] still trying to understand why its a bad move here since thats usually the first thing I do in the alehkine
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:48:36] Thank you stockfish 
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:48:50] I thought I couldnt find any moves because it was a position Id never been in before
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:49:10] but the reason was because I made a blunder and was -3 7 moves in
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[03:49:38] completely fail to undermine whites center, and he just crushes me with his space advantage
2018-10-06 13:41:24	flapz	[04:45:27] http://i.share.pho.to/baa27e7e_o.png Best move for white?
2018-10-06 13:41:24	flapz	[04:46:42] I have no idea what's going on, but mmkay... have to look at it manana
2018-10-06 13:41:24	flapz	[04:47:18] best move is worth 150cp more than 2nd
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[05:15:40] flapz, castling 
2018-10-06 13:41:24	Tilo	[05:20:20] I hate how your skills dont seem to translate well between different time controls

2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:24:54] 06:20 < Tilo> I hate how your skills dont seem to translate well between 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:25:05] different time controls
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:25:47] | Time Management/Blundervision +-300 rating
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:26:26] if you suck at both, you may well be rated 300 lower on blitz than on rapid 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:28:34] usually people with bad blundervision have games where they are on a steadily climbing curve until late middle game/endgame, when eval. drops 500 suddenly because of some silly move, and all your intricate sublte deep strategy and ideas for naught 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	+eyeoh	[13:29:24] heh
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:29:31] i.e. they are actually better than the opponents they play, judging by the chess eq. of "ball possession", when eval is in your fav. but their blunders keep their rating back 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:30:11] I think it's a thing, seems like a thing at least
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:30:26] and I think I'm a bit afflicated. 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:31:36] played a dude 30 games yesterday 5 0, he beat me 17-13, but in all 2/3 of my losses I like had him evaluation wise for 90% of the game
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:31:53] then, *brainfart* 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:33:07] 30 game Match 5 0 is epic
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:33:21] it's like heads up no limit :) 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	+drakan	[13:33:49] flapz: evaluation of score doesn't matter, only checkmate
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:34:30] drakan: what do you mean it doesn't matter? to whom? (it matters to me , a bit) 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	+drakan	[13:34:44] then you are optimizing for something besides "winning at chess"
2018-10-06 13:41:27	+drakan	[13:34:53] it is like what was seen with alpha go
2018-10-06 13:41:27	+drakan	[13:34:59] doesn't matter by how much you win, just that you win
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:37:38] as I made clear in this case, re: blunders. it's like a thing. You can outplay your opponents at your rating, being up +2 on eval for 90% of the time in your games. You can achieve the same result by being up in eval. 50% of the time. This is  an indication that the former is better player than the latter, despite achieving the same result. 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:38:22] it is not a metric that is used by anyone I know, but doesn't mean it can't be 
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:38:30] it's like "ball possession"
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:39:51] so, there's that. And it is right.
2018-10-06 13:41:27	flapz	[13:41:12] could also be an indication that you suck at endgame, or that you use your time wisely

2018-10-06 15:04:52	atchoum	If i understand correctyl, playing chess is playing the best move in 100% of the cases, isn't it ?
2018-10-06 15:09:19	+eyeoh	there's psychology too if you're playing humans
2018-10-06 15:10:48	+eyeoh	"Polgár has spoken of appreciating the psychological aspect of chess. She has stated preferring to learn an opponent's style so she can play intentionally against him or her rather than playing "objective" chess.[220] In her 2002 victory (at 25 minutes time control) over Kasparov, she deliberately chose a line Kasparov had used against Vladimir Kramnik, employing the strategy of forcing the opponent to 
2018-10-06 15:10:54	+eyeoh	"play against himself". Kasparov's response was inadequate and he soon found himself in an inferior position.[139] In an interview regarding playing against computers she said, "Chess is 30 to 40% psychology. You don't have this when you play a computer. I can't confuse it."[221]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polgár#Playing_style

2018-10-06 15:11:49	+eyeoh	I'm basically a beginner, but memorising positions feels a bit like memorising a situation when riding a bike
2018-10-06 15:12:01	+eyeoh	you look at one spot, then look away somewhere else; and remember the original spot (in theory)
2018-10-06 15:12:19	+eyeoh	so once you 'scan' an environment correctly, you decide upon the best move
2018-10-06 15:13:11	+eyeoh	I reckon as a non-computer, sometimes not playing the best move makes later moves easier; as opposed to a best move that requires a perfect sequence to follow
2018-10-06 15:13:58	+eyeoh	a bit like the agadmator's cousin playing kasparov in a simul - kasparov didn't make a perfect move because he was playing safely
2018-10-06 15:14:07	atchoum	yes I see what you mean
2018-10-06 15:14:14	+eyeoh	so I guess consistency is what matters more
2018-10-06 15:14:28	+eyeoh	being consistent, racking up points and then focusing more on matches that matter

2018-10-06 15:17:37	+Momentum	playing chess is not playing the best moves 100% of the cases, i guess that's called playing perfect chess

2018-10-06 15:22:48	+eyeoh	'perfect' vs perfect?
2018-10-06 15:23:03	+Momentum	it's quite easy to make a physical robot plays perfect chess when you already have a chess engine that plays perfect chess
2018-10-06 15:23:30	+eyeoh	I'm not sure what you're saying robot aren't capable of
2018-10-06 15:24:33	+Momentum	you said playing the best moves 100% of the time is called robot, i've never seen a robot or an engine plays the best moves 100% of the time
2018-10-06 15:25:06	+eyeoh	ok I think we're going over semantics; that's fine
2018-10-06 15:25:21	+Momentum	what do you mean by semantics?
2018-10-06 15:25:27	+eyeoh	best moves to me is what currently exists, as opposed to theoretical best moves

2018-10-06 15:45:48	+eyeoh	and some evaluations take too much time
2018-10-06 15:46:20	+eyeoh	often times there are two similarly good moves so there's no clear best, but there probably still is a best move

2018-10-06 15:46:26	+eyeoh	for most intents, both are the best
2018-10-06 15:47:02	+eyeoh	for example, I often like to quip "this is the best!" when referring to a video, etc. When reality there are many measures of best
2018-10-06 15:47:07	+eyeoh	the best what? etc
2018-10-06 15:47:20	+eyeoh	some moves are also just ugly
2018-10-06 15:47:40	+eyeoh	ugly but gets the job done in fewer moves - so is it the best?
2018-10-06 15:47:59	+eyeoh	or are we after a 5 set marathon tennis match with excitement?
2018-10-06 15:48:34	+eyeoh	Roger Federer trouncing someone in straight sets, or a tight contest in 5 sets? Both are good
2018-10-06 15:49:18	+Momentum	can you find another best move in the former position i referred to?

2018-10-06 15:49:43	+Momentum	can anyone else prove that there's a different one?
2018-10-06 15:49:48	+eyeoh	keep going until you can't figure out which the best one is
2018-10-06 15:49:50	+Momentum	or another one
2018-10-06 15:49:55	+eyeoh	I meant another game
2018-10-06 15:50:31	+eyeoh	the nature of chess means that you're not presented with mate in one in all situations
2018-10-06 15:50:40	+Momentum	it's not about me not figuring out which is the best move, it's about the existence of one
2018-10-06 15:50:54	+eyeoh	sometimes it's not so clear if there is a best move
2018-10-06 15:51:11	+eyeoh	but as far as a mortal concerned, they're all the best moves if made by a strong computer

2018-10-06 15:53:59	+Momentum	and i gave you an example
2018-10-06 15:54:14	+eyeoh	how can a human determine what constitutes a perfect game anyway?
2018-10-06 15:54:27	+eyeoh	define perfect
2018-10-06 15:55:14	+Momentum	perfect is checkmate in the least moves possible
2018-10-06 15:55:22	+Momentum	least number*
2018-10-06 15:56:09	+eyeoh	right, so what happens when a weaker opponent simply plays to avoid checkmate for longer?
2018-10-06 15:56:19	+eyeoh	vs one who plays a bit more boldly
2018-10-06 15:56:42	+eyeoh	the weaker opponent will take longer to lose - so did they play a better game?
2018-10-06 15:56:46	furrykef	I think it's "perfect enough" if it finds a longer checkmate, so long as it doesn't turn a won position into a drawn one or a drawn one into a losing one.
2018-10-06 15:57:17	+eyeoh	yeah as far as I'm concerned, all modern engines are perfect to me
2018-10-06 15:57:26	+eyeoh	the rest is just marginal gains / diminishing returns

2018-10-06 16:02:45	+eyeoh	I think it's a little difficult to judge what perfect is with chess - it's a bit like art
2018-10-06 16:12:33	+Momentum	eyeoh: avoid checkmate for longer? when a position is evaluated as #4 it's going to be a checkmate in 4 moves or less, he can't make it longer, already taken into account opponent's best choices
2018-10-06 16:12:54	+eyeoh	what about from move 0?
2018-10-06 16:13:04	+Momentum	what's that?
2018-10-06 16:13:22	+eyeoh	starting from a fresh board, two opponents vs a stronger player
2018-10-06 16:13:42	+Momentum	idk what you mean by that
2018-10-06 16:13:47	+eyeoh	does the one who avoids checkmate for longer play more perfectly, despite a more boring game?
2018-10-06 16:14:10	+eyeoh	or, does the one who takes some risks to potentially get into a winning or drawing position - yet loses earlier, play better?

2018-10-06 16:16:01	+eyeoh	just because it takes longer to mate a defensive opponent doesn't mean you've played a less good game
2018-10-06 16:17:01	furrykef	Momentum: the point was if you have a mate in 4 and you force mate in 6 you're still getting the optimal result, just not via the optimal path
2018-10-06 16:17:18	+Momentum	sure
2018-10-06 16:17:27	+eyeoh	yeah those are different things
2018-10-06 16:17:39	+eyeoh	both can be 'perfect' depending on your definition of perfect
2018-10-06 16:17:47	+eyeoh	the mate in 6 might be more beautiful
2018-10-06 16:18:01	+Momentum	your definition of perfect should take into account the time factor
2018-10-06 16:18:04	+eyeoh	it might be less obvious
2018-10-06 16:18:10	+eyeoh	yeah that's why I'm asking
2018-10-06 16:18:11	+Momentum	therefore least number of moves
2018-10-06 16:18:22	+eyeoh	fewest moves doesn't necessarily take less time
2018-10-06 16:18:56	+eyeoh	blitz mates take no time
2018-10-06 16:20:26	+eyeoh	I think it's a fascinating conundrum but perhaps neural nets aren't the answer to finding the perfect chess algorithm
2018-10-06 16:21:08	+Momentum	why would i mate my opponent in 16 when i can mate him in 2?
2018-10-06 16:21:17	furrykef	Perhaps you don't see the mate in 2
2018-10-06 16:21:22	+eyeoh	but otherwise, nearly all engines effectively play indistinguishably from perfect against weak players like me
2018-10-06 16:21:35	+eyeoh	perhaps you want to play with them like a cat and mouse
2018-10-06 16:21:36	+Momentum	i'm assuming you have the best moves
2018-10-06 16:21:53	+eyeoh	16 vs 2 is a little bit of an exagerrated example - how about 16 vs 15, but 16 is a lot more beautiful?
2018-10-06 16:21:59	+eyeoh	which is closer to perfect then?
2018-10-06 16:22:27	+Momentum	heh
2018-10-06 16:23:24	+Momentum	beautiful = perfect
2018-10-06 16:23:26	+Momentum	great

2018-10-06 16:24:21	+Momentum	i guess that's what most players of the game agree upon
2018-10-06 16:24:34	+eyeoh	I don't consider losing positions to be beautiful
2018-10-06 16:25:27	+Momentum	i mean checkmating your opponent in the least number of moves
2018-10-06 16:25:28	+eyeoh	do you have a citation for that?
2018-10-06 16:25:57	+Momentum	the citation is SF
2018-10-06 16:26:14	+eyeoh	therefore sf is perfect hah :)

2018-10-06 16:26:32	+eyeoh	how can you say not?
2018-10-06 16:26:46	+Momentum	because i know a lot
2018-10-06 16:26:55	+Momentum	:)
2018-10-06 16:27:12	+eyeoh	as far as I know, no other engine is as independent
2018-10-06 16:27:43	+eyeoh	but yes, all hail to the stockfish indeed
2018-10-06 16:27:59	+eyeoh	15:10:24 <+eyeoh> all bow to the stockfish
2018-10-06 16:29:38	+Momentum	it's funny that you always have to play the shortest mating variation because you don't know when you die :)
2018-10-06 16:30:07	+Momentum	i prefer to mate my opponent then die

2018-10-06 18:05:58	furrykef	[17:19:29] goddammit Math-o-mir
2018-10-06 18:05:58	furrykef	[17:19:50] I want to write cos(4x)^-2, but it keeps moving the exponent over between the cos and the (4x)
2018-10-06 18:05:58	furrykef	[17:20:07] cos(x)^-1 and cos^-1(x) are NOT the same thing
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:21:26] (though I think it's really stupid that they're not)
2018-10-06 18:05:59	xcombelle	[17:35:17] what is math-o-mir ?
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:37:09] It's the program I use for typing math when doing math problems
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:37:27] An example of how I use it: http://bucket.furrykef.com:9000/doing-math.png
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:37:49] It's a pretty sucky program and it baffles me that I cannot find a better one
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:38:24] People ask "Why don't you just use pencil and paper?", but you could ask the same thing about trying to use a broken word processor. We should have a good word processor instead of having to use caveman tools.
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:38:39] we went over this yesterday hey
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:38:44] yes, we did
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:39:18] the pros use chalk
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:39:48] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l789l6np-qA
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:39:51] *insert xkcd butterfly joke*
2018-10-06 18:05:59	penthief	[17:40:03] mathemicians work it out with a pencil
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:40:08] ^
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:40:19] I don't think you can be too choosy if this is what you want to do furrykef
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:40:31] as much as I dislike the term, it's 'bikeshedding', 
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:40:37] or productivity porn
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:40:37] That they want to use caveman tools is not my problem
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:40:44] they're not caveman tools
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:41:06] They pretty much are
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:41:18] do you know why the election centres where I am issue paper and pencil?
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:41:50] (people are allowed to take their own pens in, but my question: do you know why pencils are issued?)
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:42:19] why?
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:42:29] graphite is a pretty modern thing as far as writing goes
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:42:31] anyway:
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:42:42] pencils are cheaper, more reliable, and more theft proof than pens
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:42:51] they can be sharpened
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:43:09] as far as 'security' goes, that's what scrutineers are for
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:43:30] pencils have a place - I like modestly priced mechanical pencils although expensive ones exist too
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:43:36] I think the Japanese ones might be the best
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:43:53] they're also neater then pens
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:44:08] pens are just bureaucratic
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:44:39] by all means learn all the software packages; but pencil is strong
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:44:44] learn it too
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:45:19] especially if you ever sit offline exams
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:45:21] worth it
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:45:29] It's not like I don't know how to write the formulae with a pencil if I have to do it
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:45:51] so why is it? why is this a recurring topic?
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:46:33] also wow full screen irc ;)
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:47:13] Because I don't want to use a pencil if I don't have to, for the same reason I don't use a pencil write an essay or a novel
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:47:34] And yes, I like my IRC fullscreen
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:47:51] I do most stuff fullscreen, and only use multiple windows when I actually want to focus on more than one thing at a time
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:48:25] I don't think pencil for maths is a bad thing
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:48:38] some writers still write in pen too btw
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:48:43] it gives a different flow, apparently
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:49:00] so are you focusing on irc or maths right now? ;)
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:49:35] It's just the long lines thing; I often have irc in a column even if the windows adjacent are blank
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:49:53] the same reason why books aren't landscape
2018-10-06 18:05:59	furrykef	[17:50:44] I bounce back and forth
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:53:27] I use i3wm on linux and amethyst on macos; and multiple virtual workspaces/desktops on both - http://adereth.github.io/blog/2013/10/02/why-you-should-try-a-tiling-window-manager/ - something to consider
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:53:54] the desktops component emulates 'singletasking'
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:54:03] but otherwise the tiling works great for terminal windows/irc
2018-10-06 18:05:59	+eyeoh	[17:55:06] I mean if we're talking efficiency and tech; twm ftw imo

2018-10-06 20:12:24	claymore	[19:17:43] hmm, is that a lot?  I guess it is... never really thought about it
2018-10-06 20:12:24	claymore	[19:18:06] don't play so much these days
2018-10-06 20:12:24	notzmv	[19:18:46] it's quite a bit
2018-10-06 20:12:24	notzmv	[19:18:59] but I don't do bullet much so I wouldn't know
2018-10-06 20:12:24	claymore	[19:19:35] it doesn't do much for your chess, that's for sure
2018-10-06 20:12:24	claymore	[19:20:55] I started doing puzzles more lately, they're quite fun actually
2018-10-06 20:12:24	+eyeoh	[19:21:14] xcombelle: ah ok thanks

2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:36:25] I totally didn't deserve the win I just got
2018-10-06 20:12:24	xcombelle	[19:48:52]   congrats furrykef 
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:51:17] Thanks
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:51:22] I didn't deserve either of those wins, really
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:51:29] Lucky for me he sucks at time management
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:51:36] Even more than I do :P
2018-10-06 20:12:24	claymore	[19:51:57] well, time management is part of the game, ain't it
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:52:06] well yeah
2018-10-06 20:12:24	xcombelle	[19:58:19] 7... Qa5 win a bishop in second game unless I mistake
2018-10-06 20:12:24	xcombelle	[19:58:24] furrykef: 
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:58:48] xcombelle: no, you're right.
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[19:59:22] I could have easily won his queen in the first game, and I also blundered away a rook in that game but he missed it
2018-10-06 20:12:24	xcombelle	[20:02:02] Oo the tactic to win the queen is beautiful
2018-10-06 20:12:24	furrykef	[20:02:37] Is it? Seemed obvious to me once I saw it. Unfortunately, I saw it after I'd already moved...
2018-10-06 20:12:24	xcombelle	[20:09:00] yes it is obvious when you know what to look

2018-10-06 20:23:55	furrykef	So I have dy/dx (sqrt(1-y^2)) and I have to find the derivative of that (i.e. the second-order derivative)
2018-10-06 20:24:04	furrykef	I do all this math then everything cancels out until I'm just left with -y
2018-10-06 20:24:09	furrykef	Math is funny like that.

2018-10-06 22:20:49	ghostdude	it's probably the best feature I've ever seen on a chess site.

2018-10-06 22:26:18	ghostdude	i avoid it
2018-10-06 22:26:46	ghostdude	even tho i ping way better in chess.com, i don't know, i choose lichess
2018-10-06 22:27:05	atchoum	I prefer chess.com
2018-10-06 22:27:09	ghostdude	why
2018-10-06 22:27:25	atchoum	they give real time move analysis
2018-10-06 22:27:42	ghostdude	when you're observing other play

2018-10-06 22:28:12	atchoum	I think lichess is fine
2018-10-06 22:28:24	atchoum	but the fact that chess.com is a paying site reassure me somehow
2018-10-06 22:28:35	claymore	hmm, I'm surprised lichess doesn't have that feature

2018-10-06 22:30:45	atchoum	even though i'm a non paying customer
2018-10-06 22:31:02	furrykef	I don't like chess.com
2018-10-06 22:31:36	furrykef	I don't like their ads. I don't like how their spam filter banned me and I had to contact support to get my account reinstated. I don't like how they censor mention of lichess on their site.
2018-10-06 22:33:17	atchoum	well

2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:13:31] Ugh. I wish Chessable books weren't so full of variations that I simply will never see
2018-10-07 14:56:43	 *	furrykef [06:27:30] blinkblinks
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:27:46] I took the derivative of the formula for volume of a sphere and got the formula for its surface area
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:28:19] And if you take the derivative of the formula for the area of a circle, you get the formula for its circumference
2018-10-07 14:56:43	+eyeoh	[06:32:37] not sure if chess is helping me stave off sleepiness or not
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:33:14] Certainly doesn't help me in that regard. More likely I will stay sleepy but be unable to sleep 'cause my mind is too active
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[06:45:55] good morning chess fans
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:51:04] beep.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[06:52:07] boop.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[06:53:34] qed-office: I noticed that if you have a function r(t) that describes the radius of a sphere, then if you take the derivative of the function for its volume, you get its surface area. Same deal with a circle's area and circumference
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[06:54:42] volumes/surfaces are just integrals, which are just antiderivatives in simple cases
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:04:50] apparently
2018-10-07 14:56:43	emajor	[07:05:51] hello furrykef ! you seem to be doing well @ khan
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:05:57] yeah
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:06:27] Calculus is pretty easy, really. Which I find funny 'cause I was scared to death of it in high school and so refused to take a class in it
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:06:48] TBF I think I wasn't ready for it in high school, though. I didn't have the right temperament for studying math
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:10:47] But hell, I'm actually enjoying this and wish I had done it sooner
2018-10-07 14:56:43	emajor	[07:11:58] well done.. keep going!
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:12:04] thanks
2018-10-07 14:56:43	emajor	[07:12:07] where does one go after khan tho?
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:12:20] I'm wondering the same thing, but I'll figure that out when I get there.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:16:11] I submitted my review. STRONG REJECT!
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:17:05] mm.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:18:25] I've heard calculus is the last easy subject in math... it all gets uphill from there.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:19:06] when are you doing a combinatorics course furrykef ?
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:19:41] Khan Academy doesn't have one, though I imagine their statistics and probability course will cover some
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:21:14] statistics
2018-10-07 14:56:43	 *	qed-office [07:21:17] shudders
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:21:27] I'll have to take that course, it's certainly relevant to me
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:21:33] as prime minister Benjamin Disraeli said: "There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics."
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:22:02] As Benjamin Disraeli said on Family Guy: "You don't even know who I am!"
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:22:17] :)
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:26:29] I've noticed derivative notation can be a bit ambiguous at times... it seems to me dy/dx (x^2) could mean either "the derivative of x^2" or "dy/dx times x^2"
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:26:44] I suppose that's why it's more common to use [] for the former case, but stupid Math-o-mir prefers () for some reason...
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[07:34:45] I still find it kind of weird how dy/dx and the like can signify either an operator or a number
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:35:40] I am going to drink a huge cup of coffee
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[07:35:45] much still has to be done today
2018-10-07 14:56:43	+eyeoh	[07:54:21] http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-07/why-banksys-artwork-could-be-worth-more-shredded-than-intact/10348210 art
2018-10-07 14:56:43	emajor	[07:58:38] haha!
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:01:16] yeah, a very Banksy thing to do
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[08:02:48] ^_^
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:08:33] sigh
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:08:51] Of course as soon as I pat myself on the back for not making stupid mistakes anymore, I make one
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:09:03] In the middle of a calculation I dropped a minus sign
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:09:19] Simply forgot to copy it and the rest of the calculation was wrong as a result
2018-10-07 14:56:43	emajor	[08:26:10] furrykef: you in ##math yet? :D
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:31:34] nah
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[08:31:46] Though I occasionally visit when I have a math question
2018-10-07 14:56:43	 *	furrykef [09:20:42] facepalms
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:22:10] I'm given a formula for the surface area of a sphere that's changing over time and I'm asked to give the rate of change of the volume
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:22:14] I started doing all this math
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:22:26] Eventually I realized this is *exactly the same thing* I'd already done a couple hours ago
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:23:02] oop... or maybe not...
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:23:50] The answer isn't the same as the surface area after all. Hmmmm.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[09:33:25] I guess where I went wrong was I thought rate of change of volume = derivative of volume = surface area
2018-10-07 14:56:43	 *	furrykef [09:33:56] frowns, not really getting it
2018-10-07 14:56:43	+drakan	[10:56:22] furrykef: i found the relationship between motion easier to understand, in terms of derivatives / integrals, than shapes
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[12:00:56] mm
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[12:21:07] relationship ended with MOTION now DERIVATIVES are my best friend
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:25:51] artefact: the constants are giving me a hard time today
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:27:29] afternoon qed-office
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:27:43] how goes the ##chess scene?
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[12:28:24] working on a sunday, heh. remind me never to come to israel =) (i'd probably fail the questioning at the border or in the plane anyway)
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:28:37] hihi cacheyourdreams 
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:29:12] cacheyourdreams: I have not been following chess much lately
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[12:29:12] a friend got in trouble in the plane coming back to .fr, because she bought a copy of le petit prince in hebrew
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:29:27] why trouble artefact ? :o
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:29:32] it's a nice book
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[12:29:50] she got questioned over it
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:30:05] in france?
2018-10-07 14:56:43	artefact	[12:30:10] in the plane
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:30:16] I do not understand the logic
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:30:28] it does not have to do anything with politics or terrorism
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:30:59] the only people who are not allowed in are BDS people
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:31:37] cacheyourdreams: how goes it over there? all is well in new work?
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:32:31] qed-office, I haven't had much time for chess either unfortunately. Yeah, things are still going fairly well, two weeks in and no disasters yet :D
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:32:55] someone at the shared house put a nice big scratch down the side of my car the other day, but other than that nothing to complain about 
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:32:58] cacheyourdreams: that's great! I am very happy to hear it
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:33:13] oh :(
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:33:32] happens to everyone
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:33:35] happened to me once too
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:33:42] it's just an old civic so it's not a huge deal, just a little annoying
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:34:11] nodnod
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:34:34] when it happened to me I took it to the garge and the nice guy painted it for me for no charge
2018-10-07 14:56:43	cacheyourdreams	[12:35:03] needs more than a lick of paint though, two of the panels have big dents in from it
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:35:57] oh I see
2018-10-07 14:56:43	furrykef	[12:36:38] L'Hôpital's rule is weird, man.
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:36:47] well as they say in russian, let's hope that would be the worst troubles in our lives cacheyourdreams 
2018-10-07 14:56:43	qed-office	[12:37:22] tis very useful furrykef 
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[12:49:03] Hmm, looks to me d/dx ln(cx) where c is a constant still works out to just 1/x, 'cause you get 1/(cx) * c
2018-10-07 14:56:44	+eyeoh	[13:00:44] artefact: What kind of trouble/questioning?

2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:33:27] pfft. The FDIV bug is utterly insignificant except in specific scientific contexts.
2018-10-07 14:56:44	artefact	[14:33:52] so, you're saying it doesn't matter except when it matters?
2018-10-07 14:56:44	artefact	[14:34:06] i hope that was a joke
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:34:10] I'm saying that "when it matters" is very rare
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:36:40] Almost nobody was ever affected in any meaningful way by the bug
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:39:49] I mean, floating point is pretty damn inaccurate in the first place. This just made it a teensy bit more inaccurate than usual
2018-10-07 14:56:44	artefact	[14:40:31] i found the intel shareholder, guys
2018-10-07 14:56:44	artefact	[14:41:53] i used to hold some $qqq, but not anymore
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:42:19] I wish I had enough money to bother with holding Intel stock, heh.
2018-10-07 14:56:44	furrykef	[14:42:29] Not that I would really want to be holding Intel stock right now, what with their latest fuckups.
2018-10-07 14:56:44	+eyeoh	[14:45:47] I completely have no idea why my gpg in macOS has the keyserver set in ~/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf but ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf in linux

2018-10-07 15:00:06	+eyeoh	i3wm though: http://adereth.github.io/blog/2013/10/02/why-you-should-try-a-tiling-window-manager/
2018-10-07 15:00:18	artefact	i use a stripped down awesome
2018-10-07 15:00:22	+eyeoh	it works on a phone screen too, tmux
2018-10-07 15:00:34	+Momentum	really!! for remote instances only
2018-10-07 15:00:36	+eyeoh	I mean, the panes won't work well, but at least you get windows
2018-10-07 15:00:42	+eyeoh	you use tmux locally? why?
2018-10-07 15:01:08	+Momentum	why shouldn't i use tmux locally?
2018-10-07 15:01:16	+Momentum	when it can be used locally
2018-10-07 15:01:18	+eyeoh	because a tiling window manager might be much better
2018-10-07 15:01:37	+eyeoh	you're already halfway there, so have you tried i3wm?
2018-10-07 15:01:49	+Momentum	nah i hate that
2018-10-07 15:01:51	+eyeoh	I mean sure, I know heaps of people use tmux locally
2018-10-07 15:01:59	+eyeoh	and mac people use iterm2
2018-10-07 15:02:18	+eyeoh	the only time I run tmux on my desktop is if I'm in the lounge room and want to update the desktop
2018-10-07 15:02:41	+eyeoh	then I better use tmux cause if my ssh connection interrupts from the laptop sleeping or whatever, it botches dnf
2018-10-07 15:02:47	+eyeoh	dnf is a real bastard when it comes to that
2018-10-07 15:03:03	+eyeoh	the fix is a pain, although it is documented somewhere
2018-10-07 15:03:25	furrykef	[insert Duke Nukem Forever joke]
2018-10-07 15:03:26	+eyeoh	I don't usually remote into my desktop all that much though
2018-10-07 15:03:38	+eyeoh	I'm weak on the pop culture tonight :\
2018-10-07 15:03:45	+eyeoh	what's the don't touch it reference?
2018-10-07 15:03:58	+eyeoh	is it back to the future or something?

2018-10-07 15:04:36	furrykef	I would hope Doc would be sensible enough not to make a History Eraser Button
2018-10-07 15:05:13	furrykef	Though considering what else can happen with his time machine, who knows. He can't be *too* sensible...
2018-10-07 15:05:15	+eyeoh	ah
2018-10-07 15:05:19	+Momentum	i mean it feels good to kinda quickly split the terminal and execute whatever bash bullshit and come back where you were
2018-10-07 15:05:36	+eyeoh	I watched a minimal amount of ren & stimpy as a kid; they annoyed me but I was still strangely compelled for some reason
2018-10-07 15:06:00	+eyeoh	Momentum: yeah I do that with i3
2018-10-07 15:06:10	+eyeoh	mod+enter bam bam bam and I get heaps of terminals
2018-10-07 15:06:10	artefact	it takes fewer keystrokes to spawn a new term than to type tmux
2018-10-07 15:06:24	+eyeoh	that too, although with twm, it gets messy
2018-10-07 15:06:28	+eyeoh	therefore, i3wm ;)
2018-10-07 15:06:34	+eyeoh	on mac I use amethyst
2018-10-07 15:06:42	+eyeoh	it's an okay substitute, as far as macs go
2018-10-07 15:07:00	+Momentum	artefact: unless you have the right keybinding
2018-10-07 15:07:07	+eyeoh	what's your tmux bindings?
2018-10-07 15:07:09	furrykef	I remember when R&S lost me. When Ren whizzed on the electric fence. I found it too disgusting.
2018-10-07 15:07:45	+eyeoh	lol
2018-10-07 15:07:46	+Momentum	not stable yet, i was experiencing with some
2018-10-07 15:08:06	+eyeoh	I actually run default tmux bindings, with vim bindings
2018-10-07 15:08:11	+eyeoh	so yes, ctrl-b
2018-10-07 15:08:26	+Momentum	Cb ain't bad
2018-10-07 15:08:32	+eyeoh	I can reach it
2018-10-07 15:08:41	+eyeoh	it's right next to N too
2018-10-07 15:09:00	+eyeoh	and ctrl-b c is pretty quick (but not as quick as mod-enter in i3!)
2018-10-07 15:09:28	+eyeoh	I'd argue that ctrl-b c is better than ctrl-a c. Also I like to use ctrl-a a lot in readline
2018-10-07 15:09:53	+eyeoh	apparently ctrl-s and ctrl-c are also somewhat popular
2018-10-07 15:10:00	+Momentum	where do you use i3wm?
2018-10-07 15:10:03	+eyeoh	in the case of the latter, hit ctrl-c twice to cancel
2018-10-07 15:10:18	+eyeoh	where? on my desktop, running two monitors (although it was just a single one for a long while)
2018-10-07 15:10:22	+eyeoh	fedora 28 base
2018-10-07 15:10:26	+Momentum	okay
2018-10-07 15:10:43	+eyeoh	I wish my mac could run it but booting linux is a pain on the 2016 13,1 MBP
2018-10-07 15:11:29	+Momentum	i'm a bit in a painful situation, WSL + some terrible js terminal
2018-10-07 15:11:33	+eyeoh	most of the time though I use either tiling, or full screen; so amethyst is a poor person's imitation of i3 - it beats the default macOS interface imo
2018-10-07 15:11:59	+eyeoh	and liberal use of virtual desktops/workspaces on both macOS and i3
2018-10-07 15:12:25	+eyeoh	it was actually Ubuntu's Unity that got me onto the tiling concept
2018-10-07 15:12:36	+eyeoh	but that just got too slow after I upgraded my RAM...
2018-10-07 15:12:48	+eyeoh	because I ended up with even more Chrome tabs and that bogged my graphics down
2018-10-07 15:13:06	+eyeoh	I've since upgraded my graphics card and now use Firefox on that
2018-10-07 15:13:29	+eyeoh	oh, the $15 23" monitor I bought from work also encouraged me to use more tabs.
2018-10-07 15:13:58	+eyeoh	yeah I guess if you're using WSL, tmux is the next best thing
2018-10-07 15:14:20	+eyeoh	I'm using it right now (tmux), but it's the server side
2018-10-07 15:14:39	+eyeoh	via an 'always free' gce instance
2018-10-07 15:15:07	+eyeoh	the MS and Amazon offerings are unfortunately not always free
2018-10-07 15:15:23	+eyeoh	although they do have other things they're stronger with, apparently
2018-10-07 15:15:25	+Momentum	terrible free tiers
2018-10-07 15:15:35	+eyeoh	the f1-micro is pretty sufficient
2018-10-07 15:15:58	+eyeoh	161/592MB RAM used according to htop
2018-10-07 15:16:10	+eyeoh	 14:16:09 up 44 days, 18:42, 13 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
2018-10-07 15:16:22	+eyeoh	for tmux + irssi, it's plenty
2018-10-07 15:16:40	+eyeoh	44/592MB according to normal top
2018-10-07 15:16:48	+eyeoh	I have no idea how memory works
2018-10-07 15:17:04	+Momentum	array of data
2018-10-07 15:17:23	+eyeoh	speaking of tmux et al, I found out that an older version (when I was running CentOS, not Debian Stable) had some odd memory leak
2018-10-07 15:17:25	+Momentum	just kidding obviously
2018-10-07 15:17:49	+eyeoh	just goes to show how important it is to run the latest stuff for stuff you use regularly
2018-10-07 15:17:57	+eyeoh	everything else doesn't matter
2018-10-07 15:18:43	+eyeoh	kernel updates on debian stable also seem less frequent than centos, oddly enough; but that's merely a hunch
2018-10-07 15:18:57	+Momentum	MFW i3 on windows
2018-10-07 15:19:13	+eyeoh	fire up virtualbox or qemu-kvm :p
2018-10-07 15:19:31	+Momentum	RIP my CPU call it
2018-10-07 15:19:42	+eyeoh	just copy android and throw more ram at it
2018-10-07 15:19:45	+eyeoh	ram battery cpu
2018-10-07 15:20:03	+eyeoh	or replace your windows with android :p
2018-10-07 15:20:15	+Momentum	that which i don't want to do
2018-10-07 15:20:26	+eyeoh	that'd be pretty funny
2018-10-07 15:20:29	+eyeoh	make it a prank
2018-10-07 15:20:36	+Momentum	otherwise i install some linux distro instead of windows
2018-10-07 15:20:46	+eyeoh	android :p
2018-10-07 15:20:47	+Momentum	the whole point is to use windows
2018-10-07 15:20:51	+eyeoh	wait I have one better
2018-10-07 15:20:56	+eyeoh	make a desktop OS using electron
2018-10-07 15:21:15	+eyeoh	I guess chromeOS is almost that, but no
2018-10-07 15:21:24	+Momentum	not really
2018-10-07 15:21:29	+eyeoh	ChromeOS is gentoo right
2018-10-07 15:22:01	+Momentum	i guess
2018-10-07 15:22:09	+Momentum	must be using some linux shit
2018-10-07 15:24:05	+Momentum	chromeOS is decent

2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:04:41] alright; figured it out - ready to expire my 2048 bit gpg key now
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:04:51] and aussie life is fine; weather's good
2018-10-07 16:46:45	qed	[16:05:47] glad to hear it eyeoh :)
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:05:56] who needs maths and chess problems when you have gpg and git :p
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:06:27] tiled terminals across multiple displays is essential for dealing with git / gpg heh
2018-10-07 16:46:45	qed	[16:06:44] Synadze, where have you been hiding?
2018-10-07 16:46:45	qed	[16:07:43] I thought that you were eaten by a tiger
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:08:33] grue
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:16:38] didn't get around to a rapid cause I got caught up in gpg and git (indirectly thanks to Momentum and tmux?)
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:16:59] are you in the strong set?
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:17:11] lol no way
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:17:15] I have no gpg friends
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:17:38] the one person I know with a gpg key on a keyserver, has no expiry keys they appear to no longer have any control over
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:17:52] they were company keys... plus, their (desired) industry is apparently security
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:18:28] I think one of the biggest problems with gpg is that people try to be too perfect/idealistic with it, and therefore it's hard to use for many
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:18:38] GitHub encouraged me, with the green Verified boxes etc
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:18:42] crypto is either hard, or useless
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:18:44] so I went what the heck, I'll try
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:18:58] heh it's a bit black and white isn't it
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:19:12] not really, it's a tradeoff between convenience and ease of breakage
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:19:16] I don't even really have a need for GPG but eh, I figured to try it for fun anyway
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:19:31] there's always a grey, it's never perfect.
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:19:38] so it's never all useless either
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:19:40] also pgp isn't that hard
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:19:56] I mentioned GPG (yeah I meant PGP) and you said crypto though
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:20:37] I think it's a more solid concept than cryptocurrencies...
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:20:51] it's clearly useful for open source development
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:21:00] for email? not so much
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:21:19] the original intention was of course private comms, and not signing commits
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:21:30] you can also sign email
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:21:34] if we stretch the definition, I guess signing commits is sort of like email
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:21:44] also technically you sign tags, not commits
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:21:45] yeah I know
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:21:54] you can sign both can't you?
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:22:02] i don't think commits can be signed
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:22:09] git -S vs git tag
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:22:11] because the hash of the commits depends on the commit message itself
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:22:44] git help commit clearly lists -S as GPG-sign commits
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:22:48] which is different to tagging yes
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:23:00] gpg is also the easiest way to do symmetric or asymmetric crypto on individual files
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:23:01] tagging being git tag
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:23:12] yeah!
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:23:30] very few people are aware of symmetric encryption with gpg
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:24:23] just for trolls, I've 'tested' some 'technical' channels (like cryptocurrency ones..) with a symmetrically encrypted message/image
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:24:35] hardly anyone has an idea and gives up immediately thinking "I have no private key"
2018-10-07 16:46:45	+eyeoh	[16:24:43] security through obscurity :p
2018-10-07 16:46:45	artefact	[16:25:38] not really obscurity. gpg -c will add some metadata, so that gpg $file.gpg just works
2018-10-07 16:46:46	artefact	[16:25:57] even file(1) knows about it
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:28:10] artefact: https://ptpb.pw/-NUx :)
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:28:24] I half jest about obscurity
2018-10-07 16:46:46	artefact	[16:28:44] bar.asc: PGP message Public-Key Encrypted Session Key (old)
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:28:45] I mean, it technically is obscure to many people who know of gpg, but can't unlock that ^
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:29:07] it's the same reason why people might set 1234 as a password I guess
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:29:18] or use weak padlocks/combination locks
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:29:32] hmm that analogy is off
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:30:01] ok the lichess captchas are a kind of security through obscurity; but it's inconsequential
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:30:04] and it works and is fun
2018-10-07 16:46:46	artefact	[16:30:22] it isn't
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:30:46] define security through obscurity
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:32:59] "An early opponent of security through obscurity was the locksmith Alfred Charles Hobbs, who in 1851 demonstrated to the public how state-of-the-art locks could be picked and who, in response to concerns that exposing security flaws in the design of locks could make them more vulnerable to criminals, said "Rogues are very keen in their profession, and know already much more than we can teach them."[1]"
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:33:07] ok my locks analogy wasn't too off
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:33:28] how to open them is obscure enough to most people
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:34:16] but when we mix computers with novices, I guess the trouble starts when people misidentify who the 'threat actors' are
2018-10-07 16:46:46	qed	[16:34:20] lost 2 games to cheaters yesterday
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:34:30] how do you tell if they're cheating?
2018-10-07 16:46:46	qed	[16:34:41] I got 2 mails from lichess
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:34:43] wow
2018-10-07 16:46:46	qed	[16:34:55] that is notifications not mails
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:34:57] so those games just get erased then?
2018-10-07 16:46:46	qed	[16:35:08] I got my elo points back
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:35:14] still annoying as far as time goes
2018-10-07 16:46:46	qed	[16:35:22] do you guys know if there are less cheaters in chess.com?
2018-10-07 16:46:46	+eyeoh	[16:35:43] I'm told on the intertubes that the paid accounts might make cheating less prevalent but I have no idea

2018-10-07 21:51:59	artefact	[20:25:38] ^ this is why you use sasl
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:25:50] god damn
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:29:31] heh is that real ghostdude
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:29:49] use a password manager so you don't need to remember!
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:30:01] and sasl or certificates
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:30:01] yes i changed it. i'm on web freenode that's why
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:30:16] not that most ircds support complex passwords anyway
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:31:14] https://www.troyhunt.com/password-managers-dont-have-to-be-perfect-they-just-have-to-be-better-than-not-having-one/
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:32:30] but key based authentication is even better for everyday use. Because you can just disable one key without affecting others
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:34:13] watching blunderchess https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppucjZl69WI
2018-10-07 21:51:59	furrykef	[20:38:48] This is why I always identify in a status window on those occasions I must type the command manually
2018-10-07 21:51:59	furrykef	[20:39:15] In fact I usually do it anyway to keep my password from creeping into my chat logs.
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:42:04] this is the first time this has happened 
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:42:09] generally good typist
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:45:00] on another note, i've been enjoying 10 minutes on lichess. 
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:45:57] in irssi, /^msg avoids logs or something
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:46:22] ghostdude: not as embarrassing as the time I left out the / when I went to /wi someone
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:46:29] wi ghostdude
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:46:51] password length though; why so short - not even the default passwords are that short
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:46:52] i felt a bit embarassed, i had to think if i used this pw for anything else.
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:47:21] yeah I think you really must read troy hunt's link; I was sceptical at first but once you start using a password manager for sites that don't matter, you end up using it more
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:47:42] and I use an EFF diceware passphrase for the password manager (keepassxc and keepass2android)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:47:54] the latter supports fingerprint too
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:48:16] it's just too much effort trying to think of unique passwords for every site
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:48:23] eh i think people on freenode are generally nice people. I wasn't too freaked out about it.
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:48:55] I'm not concerned about that, I'm just pointing out other things to look into now
2018-10-07 21:51:59	ghostdude	[20:49:04] yeah
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:49:14] credential stuffing is annoying
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:49:31] so even if your other sites have passwords of 8 chars; it's still not good enough
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:49:52] 5 or whatever; I get it - they're throwaways
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:50:49] https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:51:03] you can also download the offline database and run your own grep -i on the md5sums
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:51:27] or the non-password form: https://haveibeenpwned.com which doesn't tell you which password
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:51:40] the database of hashes is about 5GB compressed
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:51:54] very fascinating to dig through; I definitely had some old reused passwords in there
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:53:04] and here's his talk that's an hour long, but very entertaining: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txt90iL-XzM
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:57:56] I'm only bringing this up here because people never talk about it
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:58:40] I used to think a password manager would be a hassle but it's in fact been the opposite; it's made things easier and more streamlined (I sync it with dropbox btw)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:59:07] I don't have to ask myself which site has which password (and yes I save them in firefox too which syncs)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	penthief	[20:59:25] my 1 gripe is I can't use my password manager with my phone
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:59:30] the idea being that my login is secure, and disk too (LUKS encrypted)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:59:45] penthief: if you have a fingerprint reader, then Keepass2Android handles that quickly
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[20:59:59] otherwise you can set a quick pin for that session which is um, hmm
2018-10-07 21:51:59	penthief	[21:00:00] interesting
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:01:14] the other option might be to have the browser save them; unique ones - and you'd need to secure your browser I guess
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:02:33] the only (diceware) passphrases I keep in memory these days more or less is: login, password manager, and maybe authy
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:02:53] oh and one for emailt oo
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:03:04] the email one is in case I need to access my password db
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:03:09] (e.g., fire)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:03:39] email account more important thank bank accounts
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:04:42] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware easier than it sounds but you just gotta try it (with the EFF list if English is your primary language)
2018-10-07 21:51:59	furrykef	[21:05:30] Found on Quora: "If the ace of spades is a high card in poker, does that beat 3 sevens?"
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:05:35] and also writing them down (perhaps with minimal hashing?) and placing them somewhere safe
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:05:53] furrykef: that sounds like a typical quora question
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:06:00] let me guess, people have written essays in reply?
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:06:23] deconstructing the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:07:55] I bought a set of 10 ebay dice for $10 just for diceware because why not. I could have probably generated them with a machine but that's boring
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:08:02] for $2*
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:08:55] but it doesn't need to be perfect; just anything that's better than the average which always gets leaked on big sites everywhere all the time
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:09:19] all those billions of dollars and geniuses; yet they still fall 'victim'
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:13:02] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAxgXXwrrCs Bobby Fischer's Opponent Resigns on Move 1 haha
2018-10-07 21:51:59	+eyeoh	[21:13:06] I play c4!

2018-10-07 23:51:19	+eyeoh	[23:11:35] why didn't you keep queen further away on the edge?
2018-10-07 23:51:19	+eyeoh	[23:12:13] I keep forgetting arrow keys work on that board
2018-10-07 23:51:19	+eyeoh	[23:12:24] there are so many lateral movements
2018-10-07 23:51:19	+eyeoh	[23:16:49] omg I stalemated

2018-10-07 23:53:04	+Momentum	i'm using a mouse eyeoh, also i don't want the king to run away so i leave the black king with only two squares and i bring my king
2018-10-07 23:53:20	+Momentum	it's quick enough i guess
2018-10-07 23:53:27	+Momentum	but i could probably do better
2018-10-07 23:53:46	+eyeoh	I tried trackpad and click to move and struggled
2018-10-07 23:54:54	+eyeoh	hmm what if instead of sending the king to the other side, you leapfrog the queen behind
2018-10-07 23:55:29	+Momentum	first you have to experience a little bit with SF in this case i figured that i could safely play my queen forward and to the left until the black king is in the last rank
2018-10-07 23:56:07	+Momentum	i mean you can pull those moves off very quickly
2018-10-07 23:56:33	+Momentum	Qe2 Qd2 Qe3 Qd3 Qe4 Qd4 etc

2018-10-07 23:58:09	+eyeoh	this whole bullet thing is new to me let alone hyperbullet
2018-10-07 23:58:13	+Momentum	the point is that if you think you lose time, so you go with a brute force mate
2018-10-07 23:58:56	+Momentum	if you want to do it effeciently you would consider your opponent movements and that will lose time
2018-10-07 23:59:44	+Momentum	in my case i don't care about where black goes, of course i figured that it will back up for some reason
2018-10-08 00:01:08	+eyeoh	I'm really struggling to aim the pointer with trackpad
2018-10-08 00:04:33	+Momentum	very tough with a rook

2018-10-08 12:11:34	qed	[06:19:59] yesterday I rejected a paper from publication just because they wrote it in the worst way possible
2018-10-08 12:11:35	qed	[06:20:30] it was written so badly I do not know even if it's correct or not
2018-10-08 12:11:35	flapz	[06:22:25] that's pretty bad

2018-10-08 12:54:19	+Momentum	could be interesting indeed
2018-10-08 12:54:59	+Momentum	wish my nephews were interested, i really like to monitor the improvements of kids
2018-10-08 12:55:23	furrykef	We often get little kids in our chess club. Apparently the parents hope the kid will be the next Bobby Fischer or Judit Polgár
2018-10-08 12:55:49	furrykef	Almost invariably the kids have trouble paying any attention at all to the board and it's impossible to teach them anything. They don't come back next week.
2018-10-08 12:56:52	furrykef	I always hate getting stuck trying to teach these kids. It's an exercise in futility. I do my best, but my best isn't good enough. Nothing is good enough.
2018-10-08 12:57:20	+Momentum	it's hard to overcome ADHD but when it comes to next bobby fischer stuff, i guess the kids will get older enough that time to decide themselves
2018-10-08 12:57:22	furrykef	I would be delighted though to teach a kid who can actually sit down and pay attention. Maybe one day one will come in.
2018-10-08 12:58:42	furrykef	We do have a kid (not sure how old she is) who has a reputation for being a strong player. I've only played one game against her so far, which I won, but she was playing another game at the same time and maybe she felt compelled to rush for that reason
2018-10-08 12:59:28	furrykef	(Her other opponent was an extremely slow player, so she probably started a game with me 'cause she and I were both bored)
2018-10-08 13:00:19	furrykef	She probably plays at least at my level already. I think she can make master strength eventually if she wants to.
2018-10-08 13:00:41	jmaister	furrykef: When it comes to chess and young children, it's all about small doses until they get the drive to learn themselves
2018-10-08 13:01:04	jmaister	The development of their brains have to control the rate of learning
2018-10-08 13:01:23	jmaister	You can't just place a 5 y/o behind a board and assume he's ready
2018-10-08 13:01:35	furrykef	Yeah, that's the problem. That's what these parents try to do
2018-10-08 13:01:51	furrykef	And chess club is a really shitty environment for trying to teach the game to such a person

2018-10-08 13:05:04	jmaister	I'm not a great teacher, but I use what little I know of development psychology
2018-10-08 13:06:10	furrykef	I barely have any idea how to teach chess. It doesn't help that the two hours we get (often less) are not enough to teach much more than the rules
2018-10-08 13:07:26	furrykef	Usually I start by teaching the KvRR endgame. I do this before even teaching how the other pieces move. This way they learn the basic movement of the king and the rook and the concept of checkmate all at the same time
2018-10-08 13:07:34	+Momentum	i remember when someone asked me to teach him about chess, and i started spening like an hour with the rules and they were like wut? just go straight to the point dude
2018-10-08 13:07:47	+Momentum	s/spening/spending
2018-10-08 13:08:29	furrykef	Then I teach KQvK, so they learn how the queen moves, as well as a very important endgame
2018-10-08 13:08:40	furrykef	This also introduces the idea of stalemate
2018-10-08 13:08:44	+Momentum	i mean pieces movements is already a complex subject in chess
2018-10-08 13:09:15	furrykef	After that I don't know what to do and so I just teach the rest of the pieces and start a game...
2018-10-08 13:10:02	furrykef	I should probably come up with a standard set of example positions that demonstrate some rules and tactics
2018-10-08 13:10:41	+Momentum	i remember myself was trying to learn chess for the first time, i found a playlist of videos explaining pieces but very long videos, so i went naah let's watch some games and get the point
2018-10-08 13:10:58	+Momentum	after a while i figure, okay i need to watch those videos
2018-10-08 13:11:18	furrykef	I don't remember learning the rules of the game... I was a little too young, I guess
2018-10-08 13:11:40	+Momentum	for me that was like 4 years ago or something
2018-10-08 13:11:54	furrykef	I do remember it took a while to really grasp the rules of the game... and my first opponent was my mom, who didn't know the rules either, so we got some things wrong when we first played
2018-10-08 13:12:16	furrykef	For instance we didn't realize the queen has to move in a straight line without turns
2018-10-08 13:12:41	+Momentum	hah
2018-10-08 13:12:51	jmaister	furrykef: Yeah, same. I probably learned it when I was 4-5
2018-10-08 13:13:37	furrykef	I do remember when I first started to understand chess a little bit, though: when I read a Fred Reinfeld book
2018-10-08 13:14:00	furrykef	That was when I first started learning things like pins and skewers
2018-10-08 13:14:27	furrykef	I thought, "Cool! I'll have to try to use these tricks in my games!"
2018-10-08 13:14:52	furrykef	Now, over 15 years later, and after many, many hours of drilling tactics puzzles... I still don't know how.
2018-10-08 13:17:44	furrykef	I exaggerate a bit, but tactical thinking is still kinda black magic to me.
2018-10-08 13:18:01	furrykef	Especially when it's in an actual game and not a puzzle. 'Cause at least in a puzzle you *know* there is a win.
2018-10-08 13:21:44	+Momentum	there's something very tricky about chess which is the necessity of applying the concepts your learn in parallel, you'd spend your whole life trying to get the point of chess if you think it's a linear learning process, it's not, it's really not
2018-10-08 13:22:59	furrykef	Yeah, this is a problem I'm gonna have to deal with in Virtual Chess Coach. Teaching the game in a sensible manner
2018-10-08 13:25:06	+Momentum	many people think chess goes like this, okay i'm weak because i don't know x y z, go to youtube search for x y z understand them, you're not weak anymore

2018-10-08 15:05:07	furrykef	Ugh. This question is making no sense to me
2018-10-08 15:05:21	furrykef	I'm supposed to find the absolute minimum of a function over a certain interval.
2018-10-08 15:05:42	furrykef	Easy procedure. All I have to do is take the derivative and find its zeroes, then test the original function at those x values and at the interval's endpoints.
2018-10-08 15:05:51	furrykef	But it isn't working! The answer I get isn't in the list.

2018-10-08 17:25:18	+Momentum	playing that position against stockfish is really hard for me
2018-10-08 17:26:52	Garf	It's Rxg8 of course but I somehow missed it. 
2018-10-08 17:27:56	Garf	artefact: I did about 1.5y of piano and I fiddle with guitar and bass though realistically only with Rocksmith these days 
2018-10-08 17:29:08	qed	eyeoh, oh noes, I did not like torchwood
2018-10-08 17:29:20	qed	eyeoh, is the new doctor a woman?
2018-10-08 17:29:24	Garf	With only 1 extra piece it's not trivial with white. I lost the game, too. 
2018-10-08 17:30:28	Garf	But how do the Foo can I not see a full piece en prise in a FIDE rated game. 
2018-10-08 17:30:34	+Momentum	i mean it's winning for white but the plan is not very obvious
2018-10-08 17:33:58	furrykef	We all suffer moments of blindness now and then. Even GMs do it. They just do it much, much less than I do...
2018-10-08 17:36:23	+Momentum	i think GMs suffer more than i do that's why they are better, if you don't play you don't suffer
2018-10-08 17:36:47	Garf	I wonder what training one can do to get rid of this. 
2018-10-08 17:37:00	Garf	I think I actually don't play enough. 
2018-10-08 17:37:53	+Momentum	i think that was just a moment of lack of concentration Garf, it happens
2018-10-08 17:38:06	+Momentum	what did you play instead?
2018-10-08 17:38:55	Garf	Rxe6
2018-10-08 17:39:52	+Momentum	Rxe6 is certainly not the worst move in the position
2018-10-08 17:41:07	+Momentum	Rxe6 actually and the knight is still trapped if Nf6 Rxe7
2018-10-08 17:41:25	+Momentum	i'd rather play this position against stockfish than the one when i am up a knight
2018-10-08 17:41:32	Garf	Black played against the h4 pawn
2018-10-08 17:41:33	+Momentum	(i.e the one after Rxg8)
2018-10-08 17:43:02	+Momentum	in fact it's easier to draw the position after Rxe6 Nf6 Rxe7 than to win the position after Rxg8 with white
2018-10-08 17:44:00	Garf	you dont need to play Nf6 (and lose that pawn)
2018-10-08 17:44:10	Garf	Kc7 or Rh3
2018-10-08 17:44:59	+Momentum	i mean still ...
2018-10-08 17:45:25	+Momentum	if you are going to keep your knight stuck right there as black you're not accomplishing that much
2018-10-08 17:45:51	+Momentum	but geez those pawns marching down the board

2018-10-08 18:42:37	Garf	it's so common on lichess, I don't get it
2018-10-08 18:42:52	Garf	is this because white played Ng5 once and you got crushed?
2018-10-08 18:43:15	xcombelle	several times Garf 
2018-10-08 18:43:32	Garf	There's a slightly forced sequence after Nf6 that gives black a huge compensation for a pawn
2018-10-08 18:43:47	Garf	I play this with white, and this variation is a nightmare, especially in blitz

2018-10-08 18:46:47	Garf	black must play h5 here, not h6

2018-10-08 18:47:28	Garf	here Bd7 is forced and probably ok, but most players who get into this (because they don't know theory) played Bh7

2018-10-08 21:51:28	furrykef	jmaister: well, we all gotta start somewhere.
2018-10-08 21:51:50	furrykef	The KID is very popular, though. I'm surprised you weren't familiar with it
2018-10-08 21:54:20	jmaister	I just haven't studied much theory. And even less for black
2018-10-08 21:54:55	jmaister	I tried getting a bit "serious" but I've got too much going on in my life right now, so I just play for fun and don't improve
2018-10-08 21:55:04	jmaister	Maybe one day in the future
2018-10-08 21:56:10	furrykef	I know how it is. Theory is a drag to learn and there are precious few resources on it that aren't aimed at high-rated players
2018-10-08 21:56:49	furrykef	I once posted a complaint about a book on Chessable and got a comment to the effect that the book was too advanced for my level. Well what is there *at* my level then??

2018-10-08 21:58:32	jmaister	I think once you reach basic understanding of chess and positions, you just have to take the time to learn it properly
2018-10-08 21:58:56	jmaister	also, it doesn't help that I mostly play 5+3 and don't give myself time to check the positions properly and end up blundering a lot
2018-10-08 21:59:47	furrykef	Incidentally Chessable still has no books on the KID. It's probably the most important opening they have no book on, though they have at least one book on playing against it, and they also have a book on playing the Grünfeld, which is a variant of it
2018-10-08 22:00:27	jmaister	speaking of which... quick game before I log off?
2018-10-08 22:00:48	furrykef	Sure, why not.
2018-10-08 22:01:02	furrykef	I'll probably embarrass myself, heh.
2018-10-08 22:01:21	jmaister	time control?
2018-10-08 22:01:25	furrykef	Your choice.

2018-10-09 00:31:57	+eyeoh	[23:57:54] Here we go, agadmator says mate in number of moves isn't too relevant as people can just choose to prolong death https://youtu.be/Reu9fQyMXbU
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[23:59:35] I'm tempted to fire up my old Kasparov Sensor Chess board and see how well I play against it nowadays
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[23:59:42] I could perhaps use it to practice playing OTB...
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:00:21] Heh, I used to like playing with it even against humans because it will check move legality for you. Not something I need anymore...
2018-10-09 00:31:57	whomsoever	[00:03:03] I have an old electronic board that I use when I go to the cabin, since there is no electricity there, it's pretty cool, it's like 20 or 25 years old
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:04:00] Kasparov Sensor Chess is from 1994, so it might be one of those. Does it look like this? http://www.spacious-mind.com/assets/images/saitek_sensor_large.gif
2018-10-09 00:31:57	whomsoever	[00:05:33] yeah! looks like it a lot, but it's not a Kasparov board
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:05:37] It has a 68HC05 CPU, 8 KB ROM, and 176 bytes of RAM... so I imagine it's pretty weak.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:06:50] So it's comparable in computing power to an Atari 2600, though it doesn't have to waste CPU time drawing on the TV screen.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:08:30] (And in fact the majority of the CPU time on the Atari 2600 is spent on rendering, not on any kind of game logic)
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:09:37] In fact there's a chess game for the 2600 and at higher difficulty levels it basically turns the screen off while the computer is thinking in order to avoid that problem.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:17:19] WTF. The 68HC05 allowed only 32 bytes of stack. That's kinda bizarre.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:21:56] Correction, 64. Still bizarre.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	+JimmyRustles	[00:22:23] is that a lot?
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:23:41] That's very little, even for the time. Enough for most programs, but chess programs probably use more stack than most programs.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:24:19] The 6502 was released in 1976 and it allowed 256 bytes of stack.
2018-10-09 00:31:57	furrykef	[00:26:32] Er, 1975, actually, though it was probably a limited run and the earliest 6502's were buggy.

2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[06:39:02] flapz: add a 15 seconds to their clock when they realized they are in a lost position
2018-10-09 12:53:49	+baraba	[07:12:28] or just take a lot of your time on your moves, make them think about how lost their position is
2018-10-09 12:53:49	+baraba	[07:12:43] this gets them to resign really fast
2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[08:09:27] also good baraba lol
2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[08:12:01] how have you been lately baraba ?

2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[10:40:57] regular chess is difficult enough for me lol

2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[11:34:48] no thanks
2018-10-09 12:53:49	flapz	[11:35:14] that's my game plan, trying to tilt my opponents, like Conor McGregor 
2018-10-09 12:53:49	qed-office	[11:36:31] isn't he kind of a douche?

2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[14:26:56] whomsoever, I am fine thank you, enjoy your chess day! :)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[14:52:36] qed: I'm just about done with differential calculus and should be moving on to integral calculus today
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[14:52:47] My understanding is it's mostly the same thing, but backwards
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[14:53:46] i.e. if f'(x) = 6x^2 then f(x) = 2x^3 + C, right?
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[14:56:35] yes furrykef 
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[14:56:58] integral is the area under the curve
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[14:57:03] a derivative is the slope
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[14:59:28] yes, I knew that too
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:00:58] ok no more spoilers :)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:01:23] in sciences and applied math, integrals are often used to approximate sums
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:01:38] as the direct computation of sums is sometimes very difficult
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:01:57] I think we get to that eventually
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:02:18] yes furrykef , there is not course on earth that does not touch this point as it is perhaps the most important one in the course
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:03:09] how have you been lately furrykef? all is well in furry world?
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:03:22] Seems strange then to teach differential calculus before integral calculus
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:03:40] (That seems to be the traditional order, not just this course's)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:03:42] we studied it that way too furrykef 
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:03:58] maybe because derivative is easier to define
2018-10-09 16:59:27	+eyeoh	[15:04:04] !rating eyeoh rapid

2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:04:05] it's just a limit
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:04:07] I'm OK. Dealing with some issues in my life, but I'll live.
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:04:32] while an integral is defined by riemann sums which is a more complicated concept arguably
2018-10-09 16:59:27	+eyeoh	[15:04:37] I think I hustled out a second win from rematch by messing around in the first game
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:04:46] good evening artefact 
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:04:54] o7
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:05:02] how are you today artefact ?
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:05:15] Heh, it's just a limit but most of the material I've done so far doesn't really treat it as a limit. It's just a series of rules, like ax^b = abx^(b-1)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:05:40] it is a series of rules just to very simply function
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:05:44] *very simple functions
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:05:55] most function have no simple rules for integration
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:06:06] pretty bad, painkillers aren't working anymore
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:06:13] going to be a hard week if it doesn't calm down
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:07:08] artefact, I am sorry to hear it my friend, do feel better
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:07:37] furrykef, the most common example of a function with no "simple" is e^(x^2)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:07:46] *no "simple" integral
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:08:06] the area under the curve exists of course but there is no "simple" function to represent it
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:08:09] e^x/x, too
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:08:16] no closed form antiderivative
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:08:43] ohh I forgot this example, also quite nice one
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:10:10] mm
2018-10-09 16:59:27	furrykef	[15:11:22] Little exceptions like that are why I said "*mostly* the same thing but backwards" ;)
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:12:45] simple functions can be deceiving too. 1/x antidifferentiates to ln(x)+c, and a common definition of ln is “the antiderivative of 1/x with ln(1)=0”
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:13:06] at least before you “properly” define it through power series
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:17:26] yes you can't be serious without a power series
2018-10-09 16:59:27	+drakan	[15:17:44] taylor series is a superset of power series ?
2018-10-09 16:59:27	+drakan	[15:18:28] oh same thing
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:19:04] they're different objects entirely
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:19:27] power series are super polynomials, where you worry a lot about convergence
2018-10-09 16:59:27	artefact	[15:19:42] formal power series are where you don't care about convergence
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:20:56] formal power series is very useful to describe generating function
2018-10-09 16:59:27	qed	[15:21:06] to count stuff in combinatorics
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+drakan	[15:21:15] is there a generating function for digits of pi :D
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+drakan	[15:21:18] or primes
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:21:48] drakan, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+drakan	[15:22:19] thanks !
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:22:22] drakan, The discovery of this formula came as a surprise. For centuries it had been assumed that there was no way to compute the nth digit of π without calculating all of the preceding n − 1 digits
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+drakan	[15:22:48] can that discovery be used to prove the digits of pi are truly random then ?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:23:30] π being normal is still an open problem, iirc
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:25:45] yeah an open question
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:25:57] does not seem like an easy open question either
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:26:10] that's why it's still open :D
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:28:14] ^_^
2018-10-09 16:59:28	CuriousErnestBro	[15:28:49] hello
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:29:00] good day to you CuriousErnestBro 
2018-10-09 16:59:28	CuriousErnestBro	[15:29:01] Can linear programming solve chess?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	CuriousErnestBro	[15:29:09] Good day to you too qed
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:39:23] linear programming can not solve chess
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:39:47] one reason for that is that we can solve linear programs in polynomial time while chess is NP-hard on general sized boards
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:41:07] a better way to explain it is that while chess might be formulated as a linear program this linear program will be immense, so huge it won't be solvable in any time we see as reasonable
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:41:51] https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/candid-camera-what-drivers-are-really-doing-behind-the-wheel-20181004-p507sj.html No focus
2018-10-09 16:59:28	prsstnt	[15:43:40] i got a question
2018-10-09 16:59:28	prsstnt	[15:44:59] is checkmate exactly the same as the idea of the king being taken?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:45:08] https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-6252613/Liverpools-Trent-Alexander-Arnold-suffers-defeat-against-world-chess-champion-Magnus-Carlsen.html
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:45:15] yeah
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:45:29] engines usually do “checkless chess” for simpler programming. the rules are equivalent
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:45:37] well, except for move legality
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:46:07] “checkless chess” also conveniently explains how a pinned piece can still give check
2018-10-09 16:59:28	prsstnt2	[15:48:41] hmm ok thanks for that artefact 
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:49:49] prsstnt2: I believe in over the board speed chess, you can capture the king if the opponent doesn't see a check
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:50:12] No idea if that is a standard rule though? I guess it fits under the illegal move category too
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:50:27] Moving another piece while in check seems illegal
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:52:48] qed: After watching agadmator's analysis of that match, I reckon I could beat Trent ;)
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:53:12] eyeoh, yeah he would be harder to beat at soccer I suspect
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:53:31] That's okay because I'd beat him at piano and cycling too :p
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:53:40] Maybe not cycling
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:53:47] Depends on the category
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:53:49] I don't understand the big deal about this, it's PR, and stupid at that. Why would this soccer guy be any different at playing chess than the regular joe?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:54:08] Well some said he lasted twice as long as Bill Gates
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:54:27] But I agree with agadmator and would say moves count isn't relevant
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:54:28] who said that? stormy daniels
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:54:29] ?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:54:33] Doesn't matter. You can stall if you have half a brain.
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:54:34] but there's no correlation between game length and actual skill
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:54:46] I agree
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:54:54] Watch the last YouTube video I linked today
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:55:40] https://youtu.be/Reu9fQyMXbU
2018-10-09 16:59:28	qed	[15:55:41] number of moves is not a good indicator I agree
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[15:55:54] unless is 3 or 4
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:56:24] I figure all the blitz games going into 100+ moves where the last 50 are just moving pieces under 5 sec in the clock, are the most skillful!
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:56:31] Apparently Trent could see Magnus's eye tracking
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:56:41] I'd lose to Magnus blind folded
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:56:55] Him being blindfolded that is
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:57:02] I am sure a lot of people would lose to 2800+ rated players playing blindfolded. Even blind simul.
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:57:19] Yeah so that calls into question the software gimmick
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:57:28] Unless Trent was using stockfish?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:57:55] it might be of some use still. I'm sure he was looking at the pieces rather than blindly staring at the board
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:57:56] The moves were clearly not stockfish level
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:58:25] visualization still helps a lot. you cannot expect to play at the same level blindfolded
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:58:32] Nah I'm pretty sure it hindered more than helped
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:58:56] however, the information doesn't do a whole lot unless you can actually extrapolate moves in your head
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:59:06] That's it
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:59:43] Most games you can tell where a stronger player is looking
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[15:59:50] however, magnus is paid to play chess, soccerprincesses are paid to soccer. let's leave it at that
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[15:59:54] The obvious traps don't deserve much time
2018-10-09 16:59:28	furrykef	[16:00:00] I wonder what, if anything, quantum computers will do for chess
2018-10-09 16:59:28	artefact	[16:00:33] i worry more about cryptography
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[16:00:46] I'm happy to discuss football, after all, Trent decided to discuss chess
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[16:00:57] soccer, but nice try
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[16:01:08] I want to know more about the match background
2018-10-09 16:59:28	furrykef	[16:01:09] I've tried to learn about quantum computing and I really don't have much of a handle on what it is. Most talk about it is either abstract enough that you don't get much of an idea what you can do, or else it requires you to understand quantum physics to understand it.
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[16:01:41] let's invest into D-WAVE, because it's not like they're a total scam at all!
2018-10-09 16:59:28	+eyeoh	[16:01:53] I know someone who works in quantum computing or something so plan to not pretend to know what I'm talking about
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[16:02:06] "b-b-but g-g-google has d-d-dwave...!"
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[16:03:30] don't tell me eyeoh, the revolutionary breakthrough is about 6 months tops, away from now?
2018-10-09 16:59:28	vmt	[16:04:06] i'm sure they're just short on equity... or something along those lines
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:07:47] No the rule is always 10 years away
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:08:22] I'm pretty sure Google isn't the only one working on stuff like that. I doubt we'd see it put into chess any time soon though
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:08:55] It seems like alphazero will approach "perfection" faster
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:09:08] Think connect 4 or tic tac toe
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:09:54] Interestingly, stockfish managed to not lose every game against alphazero last year even without an opening book or whatever
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:10:08] the validity of the match is questionable, at best.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:10:23] I don't understand what the nerfing was about
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:10:26] which is not a surprise, it being conducted by a company protecting its own interests
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:10:32] Google had a whole internet connection?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:10:33] never mind that nobody on the planet can reproduce their results
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:10:36] ...how about that for a reason.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:10:48] this isn't research. it's just advertising and self-congratulation
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:10:54] ^
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:11:34] and obviously you will only ever release x amount of matches ever, and i'm sure there was no cherry-picking involved
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:11:49] -ever. one too many.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:12:13] I think that borders on a conspiracy theory - I get what you're saying, but Google has the results with AlphaGo
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:12:33] vs. a human opponent.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:12:34] I just want to see an fair rematch with AlphaZero and stockfish
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:12:48] define fair?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:12:52] I don't think there are any suitably qualified computer go engines
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:12:56] equal amount of watts?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:13:05] artefact: The million dollar question
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:13:07] and i'm quite sure development wrt. chess engines are far more advanced than those for go
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:13:15] development is*, rather.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:13:19] yes, exactly that.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:13:37] so what results exactly? the go match is not comparable by any standards.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:13:46] Let's see stockfish at its normal full potential for starters
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:13:52] of course you can beat stockfish by throwing GPUs and upping the ops/s by a factor of 100, compared to cpu only
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:14:04] that's interesting, but not /fair/ in my opinion
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:14:25] Well taking away the opening book is less fair
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:14:39] I don't actually know what that means
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:15:47] artefact: gpus are not exactly well-suited for chess engines
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:15:57] Objectively (without getting into the advertising nuances), I think the clearest example of ML being dodgy is all the dodgy results it still comes up with to date
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:16:09] you would be better off just running x86
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:16:50] ML?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:16:58] Machine learning
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:17:09] well, it's the new fad.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	artefact	[16:17:10] magic lantern
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:17:18] It still makes a lot of mistakes, but that's not so apparent with go or chess
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:17:22] so obviously you take every chance to promote it.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:17:42] ...especially when you're company is balls deep buying into it
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:17:52] Okay
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:17:52] your*. need more coffee.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:17:59] That doesn't answer the question though
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:18:17] Is stockfish stronger than alphago?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:18:18] i didn't know there was one
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:18:35] you're comparing apples and oranges?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:18:55] It's not the hardest question to reply to
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:19:21] not implying its difficulty, i'm saying the question makes no sense, i.e. it's quite impossible to answer to
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:19:31] Rally behind stockfish with whatever resource you can throw at it - can it beat alphazero?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:19:45] I clearly meant alphazero, not alphago - relax
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:20:00] i'm certain it will
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:20:09] Okay goodo
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:20:13] Next question:
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:20:20] What resources are necessary?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:20:31] Please stop reading malice into my discussion
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:20:45] cpu-time and memory, just like all programs ever to have been written
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:21:16] and we could go into nitpicking there but i digress
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:21:29] I think furrykef asked a legitimate question about quantum computing and you just went to trash it on a tangent about Google
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:21:49] Google aren't even the only ones researching it
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:22:10] If you want to point to why quantum this or that is bullocks, please enlighten us
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:22:11] no, i didn't, and you are grossly misrepresenting me
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:22:38] I'll scroll back up and see if that's the case
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:23:20] originally, what I said, was (wrt quantum computing), that D-WAVE is probably the leading researcher (whatever that means) in the field, and that even they are selling nothing but false hopes and air
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:23:50] and the company has gotten good PR, because i.e. google bought a unit from them, a unit, which is completely useless.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:24:18] and then you picked up on the google-thing, continuing into alphazero.
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:25:21] Okay let's focus back on that topic then - do you think quantum computing research is a waste of time?
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:25:33] You seem very cynical
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:25:52] Almost belittling
2018-10-09 16:59:29	vmt	[16:25:59] no, but i think generating hype around it prior to having a functional prototype or even a proof-of-concept is completely, a waste of time
2018-10-09 16:59:29	+eyeoh	[16:26:18] I think that depends on what you define as being hype
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:26:27] I don't see a lot of news about it
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:27:01] as with everything, fads come and go, so does hype. right now the trendiest things are blockchains and AI, in this space
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:27:01] I just know a theoretical physicist and surprisingly, that might be his area of work (not with Google though to the best of my knowledge)
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:27:22] This still doesn't answer furrykef's question
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:28:06] i never claimed to have been trying to answer his question, nor was my remark addressed to him specifically
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:28:36] I think for any meaningful comparison, we first need to find out what the strongest engine is to pit against future quantum chess computer
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:29:01] Okay that's fine - well I'm asking again now
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:29:19] We can talk about Google and capitalism though if you find that more interesting
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:29:26] i think we first need that functional quantum computer, though
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:29:36] (they're shutting down Google+ heh)
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:30:02] A functional quantum computer that can do what regular computers do is a given yes
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:30:05] no, the topic is boring. but the reasoning behind releasing a handful of matches and so on, seems quite clear-cut
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:30:25] Ok
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:30:33] You did bring it up first
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:31:05] Oh matches, not machines
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:31:19] ...yeah
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:31:56] What do you think it'd take for stockfish to beat alphazero in last year's state?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:32:34] that question is highly hypothetical, and one that cannot really be answered easily. it would take some research to answer it
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:33:18] Is there a tool to tell which engine someone used to cheat? After analyzing one of my games with a friend, the computer indicated that he only made 1 inaccurate move.

2018-10-09 16:59:30	artefact	[16:33:44] maybe your friend just played well
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:34:00] Could be.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:34:09] Be careful about accusing friends of cheating

2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:34:55] what ratings are these?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:34:58] My best guess is that your friend is just stronger?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:35:04] Lichess
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:35:13] alright
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:35:20] !rating eyeoh rapid
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+botfisch	[16:35:21] eyeoh: lollycopter: rapid: 1450 (N=32, Δ=31, σ=70)
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:35:31] Ignore my provisional classical rating
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:35:43] It's got to be far lower
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:36:39] xtolid: What's your friend's rating?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:36:57] He beats me every time. I just thought that over the course of a full length game, he would have made a move or two that the computer would have thought weren't the best move.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:37:17] He doesn't have an account. He just plays as a guest.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:37:30] Hmm yeah you'd need to see his other games too
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:37:51] Or just play OTB :)
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:38:06] lol
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:38:16] How many games have you computer analysed so far?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:38:55] Only one. I didn't think he was cheating until I saw the analysis. I'll keep our files from future games. I don't want to call him out on it until I know for certain.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:39:05] Because if they're 2000 or whatever and you're 1400, maybe his responses deserve nothing deep?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:39:39] You might not need to ever call him out even if he does cheat.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:39:40] That could be. I'm definitely still just learning. 
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:39:50] aren't we all, always
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:40:07] If someone cheats, that information is more useful to you as a secret
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:40:36] I had considered that too. 
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:40:54] As for whether that's ethical in itself, I don't know
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:41:23] You should encourage him to get an account anyway
2018-10-09 16:59:30	xtolid	[16:42:01] I will do that. Thanks for the input!
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+eyeoh	[16:42:25] Probably the simplest way to a resolution!
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+drakan	[16:50:05] vmt: you dont think d-wave is selling functional quantum computers ?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:51:02] drakan: yes, i don't
2018-10-09 16:59:30	+drakan	[16:51:16] vmt: so you dont believe they offer 2000 qubits via web service ?
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:51:28] up to the point where the scientific community has been speculating over their functionality
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:51:38] drakan: you can advertise what you want.
2018-10-09 16:59:30	vmt	[16:51:55] look into it.
2018-10-09 16:59:31	+drakan	[16:52:33] burden of proof is on you, really
2018-10-09 16:59:31	+Jik	[16:53:19] vmt can call it "quantum computing" but no sensible quantum computing guy would call it quantum computing
2018-10-09 16:59:31	+Jik	[16:53:24] umm what
2018-10-09 16:59:31	+Jik	[16:53:27] d-wave can call it "quantum computing" but no sensible quantum computing guy would call it quantum computing
2018-10-09 16:59:31	vmt	[16:54:00] the burdne of proof is actually on the seller
2018-10-09 16:59:31	vmt	[16:54:16] the burden of being a fool - OTOH - is on the buyer
2018-10-09 16:59:31	+drakan	[16:58:20] Just cite a source instead of hand waving ?

2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:34:42] Nice game I just played: https://lichess.org/19M4AtMOHqXI
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:36:13] Though I did hang my knight with 13.Qa7. ...Bxc3+ is check, so it black could still stop mate afterward.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:43:08] So I guess it wasn't TOO nice.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:44:10] Weird how he castled into my attack. Did he not realize I was going to attack queenside?
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:46:42] yeah vmt you seem strangely combative
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:51:17] furrykef: heh well that's blitz I guess
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:52:20] hmm we may or may not be about even on rapid
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:53:06] I don't play rapid, really. Yesterday was the first time I played it in forever, and only because jmaister wanted a game.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:55:08] you notch up quite a few rapid wins with 1700s
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:55:24] so maybe not so even for me hah
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+drakan	[17:57:30] i wish i could play against just 1700+ lol
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+drakan	[17:57:35] guess i have to earn my way there first
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:57:38] Classical is my preferred time control but I usually play blitz online 'cause of the quick and easy games, and because it's a better test of pattern recognition
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:58:49] interesting how you go for blitz and classical but not rapid
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[17:59:24] Rapid is the worst of both worlds to me.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[17:59:36] due to end game?
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:00:03] Not enough time for me to think and it's not any better a test of pattern recognition than blitz is.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:00:31] So to me it's like blitz but takes longer.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:01:52] what's the average duration per side with 5+3? 7 minutes?

2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:04:32] this artile is really long
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:05:24] eyeoh: dunno
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:05:49] I do know that time scrambles are bad enough at 5+3 that I don't really wanna play 5+0
2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:08:53] furrykef: this dots are pissing me off im missing the game so cant really know how you won or lose
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:08:53] why not 10+0 then
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:09:55] maximum time for a 100 move 5+3 game is 10 minutes, I think
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:10:11] per side
2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:10:32] wtf
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:10:51] I don't like no-increment, period
2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:10:51] what is this arrows
2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:11:14] "learn from your mistakes" why they didn't add it to the app
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:11:16] I just try to move quicker early and then not worry too much about time mid game
2018-10-09 18:22:36	beeman	[18:11:28] app is so shit and featureless
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:11:39] if it's 2 vs 5 minutes, I just back myself to finish
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:12:43] as for 10+x, that of course takes too long to pair up
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:13:13] oh no lichess timeout
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+drakan	[18:15:21] 5+0 is my favorite because of the time pressure it puts on me
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:17:44] lol
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:17:48] you insane :p
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:18:17] I've never tried anything less than 10+0 in my life
2018-10-09 18:22:36	furrykef	[18:18:49] Try it. It's fun.
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+eyeoh	[18:20:28] :s
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+drakan	[18:21:24] it's pretty stressful, but i found i did very well in 10+0 afterwards
2018-10-09 18:22:36	+drakan	[18:21:35] i just dinged 1400 in 5+0 :D

2018-10-09 18:27:22	+eyeoh	and I enjoy ratings because they're indicative of progress/state of mind
2018-10-09 18:27:37	+Momentum	pomodoro is great pomodoro is turning your tasks into tomatoes
2018-10-09 18:27:46	+eyeoh	if I get a string of puzzles incorrect, it might mean break time
2018-10-09 18:28:05	+eyeoh	I bought a real tomato timer too but it's too loud
2018-10-09 18:28:18	+eyeoh	so mostly use kanbanflow without the timer
2018-10-09 18:29:13	+Momentum	personally when solving tactics i start really bad with the first few puzzles then i sober a little bit then i go down again
2018-10-09 18:29:46	+eyeoh	I'm the opposite
2018-10-09 18:30:00	+eyeoh	I do best at the start with anything and then taper
2018-10-09 18:30:21	+eyeoh	like taking photos for instance - usually it's the first shot that's best
2018-10-09 18:30:40	+eyeoh	I think it's a fatigue thing

2018-10-09 19:10:24	+eyeoh	hehe

2018-10-09 19:13:40	+Momentum	artefact: white is checkmated :P
2018-10-09 19:13:42	+Momentum	just kidding
2018-10-09 19:13:49	+Momentum	i feel like i should know the answer
2018-10-09 19:15:00	+eyeoh	Momentum: solved your easier one; although interestingly stockfish's response for black was a quiet move rather than capture
2018-10-09 19:15:35	+Momentum	what's the answer?
2018-10-09 19:17:02	+eyeoh	the same as what stockfish suggested for white
2018-10-09 19:18:10	+eyeoh	black's no option reply of Rxh6 still seems better than the default arrow though
2018-10-09 19:18:42	+Momentum	you mean Ke6?
2018-10-09 19:19:06	+eyeoh	yes but I'm moving on to black's perspective now
2018-10-09 19:19:17	+eyeoh	what should black play after white Ke6?
2018-10-09 19:19:26	+Momentum	0-0-0 check
2018-10-09 19:19:39	+Momentum	or O-O-O depending on your notation
2018-10-09 19:19:58	+eyeoh	that'd be O-O but I didn't even see that as a possibility
2018-10-09 19:20:17	+eyeoh	engine forbids it
2018-10-09 19:20:18	+eyeoh	hmm
2018-10-09 19:20:27	+Momentum	wut?!! aw stupid me that's a king side castle true
2018-10-09 19:20:30	furrykef	Pretty sure you should use O instead of 0 for castling
2018-10-09 19:20:40	artefact	both are correct
2018-10-09 19:20:55	+eyeoh	I'm not debating O vs 0
2018-10-09 19:21:05	+eyeoh	that's not a queen side castle
2018-10-09 19:21:12	+Momentum	yeah yeah
2018-10-09 19:21:13	+eyeoh	so it'd be 0-0, not 0-0-0
2018-10-09 19:21:14	+Momentum	king side
2018-10-09 19:21:27	+eyeoh	either way it's not letting me castle
2018-10-09 19:21:33	furrykef	Nobody is saying you were debating the O's
2018-10-09 19:22:12	+eyeoh	oh well I said O-O and I thought you were saying 0-0-0 was correct
2018-10-09 19:22:27	+Momentum	well anyway, i didn't add the castling permission to the FEN, usually those problems are given as a picture instead, so you actually don't know what white's last move was
2018-10-09 19:22:38	+Momentum	or if he had permission to castle king side
2018-10-09 19:22:39	+eyeoh	ah
2018-10-09 19:22:49	+eyeoh	now that makes sense
2018-10-09 19:22:51	+Momentum	there are two solutions to the problem
2018-10-09 19:23:05	+Momentum	either en passent hxg6
2018-10-09 19:23:12	+Momentum	followed by Rd8
2018-10-09 19:23:35	+Momentum	or if white had caslting permission or Ke6
2018-10-09 19:23:40	+eyeoh	it's not letting me en passant either
2018-10-09 19:23:41	+Momentum	if he didn't
2018-10-09 19:24:05	+Momentum	i didn't add those to the FEN eyeoh
2018-10-09 19:24:23	+eyeoh	so what's the alternative to Ke6?
2018-10-09 19:24:47	+Momentum	hxg6
2018-10-09 19:25:27	+Momentum	that is if white's last move was g7g5
2018-10-09 19:25:34	+eyeoh	that's an assumption yes
2018-10-09 19:25:45	+eyeoh	hmm what's the descriptive notation for that
2018-10-09 19:25:53	+eyeoh	this is where algabraic falls short
2018-10-09 19:25:59	+eyeoh	algebraic*
2018-10-09 19:27:00	+Momentum	well, i'm a modern dude

2018-10-09 19:28:36	+eyeoh	we'd need the full move list
2018-10-09 19:28:37	artefact	instead of having just one set of coordinates, it named squares like “King bishop 2", which would mean f2 if you're white or f7 if you're black
2018-10-09 19:29:01	+eyeoh	I learned descriptive first, but never got good at it
2018-10-09 19:29:16	+eyeoh	there was a certain elegance to it

2018-10-09 19:29:34	+eyeoh	easy clicky
2018-10-09 19:29:35	artefact	it's longer. both to say and to write
2018-10-09 19:30:20	artefact	an old old notation used Kt instead of N for knight

2018-10-09 19:30:51	+Momentum	until i saw that terrible notation
2018-10-09 19:31:15	+eyeoh	heh descriptive also covers double checks
2018-10-09 19:31:38	+Momentum	although i'm fine with the French notation because they use it a lot here, Cf3 for Nf3
2018-10-09 19:31:48	artefact	i'm french and even i don't use it
2018-10-09 19:31:57	+Momentum	oh! why?
2018-10-09 19:32:02	+eyeoh	algebraic doesn't cover what pieces are captured at all and that I don't like a lot

2018-10-09 19:34:17	+eyeoh	heh furrykef speaking of not using pencils - I've never written out chess notation during play before
2018-10-09 19:34:20	artefact	it's standard to localise algebraic notation. i've seen german players write Lc5 on their sheets
2018-10-09 19:34:58	+Momentum	is that Nc5?
2018-10-09 19:35:05	artefact	laufer = runner = bishop
2018-10-09 19:35:10	artefact	knight is springer (jumper)
2018-10-09 19:35:11	+Momentum	oh makes sense
2018-10-09 19:35:35	+Momentum	the bishop visits the c5 square more often than the knight
2018-10-09 19:35:41	xcombelle	the worst notation is the one used by uci: square of start move square of endmove and maybe piece of promotion
2018-10-09 19:35:42	artefact	king is König (king), queen is Dame (lady), pawn is Bauer (farmer)
2018-10-09 19:35:59	artefact	rooks is Turm (tower)
2018-10-09 19:36:18	+Momentum	it's useful xcombelle
2018-10-09 19:36:21	+Momentum	that's protocol
2018-10-09 19:36:29	xcombelle	indeed, but unreadable
2018-10-09 19:36:37	+eyeoh	I'm happy to use whatever agadmator uses because he's so smooth with it
2018-10-09 19:36:38	artefact	yeah, long algebraic notation is far more practical for programs
2018-10-09 19:36:40	+Momentum	it's not meant to be read by human anyway
2018-10-09 19:36:55	artefact	short one requires movegen, and that can be slower/harder
2018-10-09 19:37:05	+Momentum	yes
2018-10-09 19:38:14	xcombelle	artefact actually speed should not be a concern, main variation is nothing in front of total search, but complexity of the engine is a real problem
2018-10-09 19:39:07	+Momentum	move generation speed is very crucial
2018-10-09 19:39:15	artefact	not really. you'd just write a function to parse it. speed is definitely the concern
2018-10-09 19:39:45	artefact	in fact, you can crash stockfish very easily by feeding it illegal moves, or an illegal start position
2018-10-09 19:39:49	artefact	because it  won't bother checking anything
2018-10-09 19:40:10	+Momentum	d1c3 is far easier to parse than Qxc3
2018-10-09 19:40:23	+Momentum	d1f3* rather
2018-10-09 19:41:23	furrykef	Parsing Qxc3 is easy. Finding which square the Q in question is on is the annoying part.
2018-10-09 19:41:53	+Momentum	my first attempt at creating a chess engine, i went straight ahead writing an AI for python-chess which was considerably slow at move genration and that failed badly
2018-10-09 19:42:40	+Momentum	that's the point furrykef with d1f3 you don't have to look at where the queen is or where the capturer is
2018-10-09 19:42:57	+eyeoh	hmm my 1665 correspondence opponent is being quite aggressive in response
2018-10-09 19:43:06	+eyeoh	I hope I'm gaining tempo
2018-10-09 19:43:46	+Momentum	i don't know if python-chess was slow or python itself was slow, but anyway
2018-10-09 19:44:37	furrykef	Momentum: I was just nitpicking your use of the term "parsing".
2018-10-09 19:45:05	furrykef	Finding which square is an issue of the semantics of the expression, not the syntax.
2018-10-09 19:45:25	 *	furrykef is great fun at parties
2018-10-09 19:48:45	+Momentum	i'm not discussing any of that i'm afraid
2018-10-09 19:51:12	+Momentum	artefact: so they avoid some check_board() stuff for speed?

2018-10-10 00:06:05	eyeoh	I thought my other replies would have answered it though
2018-10-10 00:06:21	eyeoh	sometimes I like to answer questions a step ahead because there's extra information within
2018-10-10 00:06:38	eyeoh	like, "I play mostly rapid and puzzles" would suggest I know the rules?
2018-10-10 00:06:58	eyeoh	and also my linking to a particular spot in the game suggests I know where the analysis is else how would I know what blunder I made?
2018-10-10 00:07:06	penthief	I did not mean the rules of chess
2018-10-10 00:07:11	eyeoh	let me know if I've ignored any other questions
2018-10-10 00:07:20	penthief	I did not mean the post game analysis board
2018-10-10 00:07:43	penthief	that doesn't sound sincere
2018-10-10 00:07:44	eyeoh	I'm not ignoring you; I'm right here

2018-10-10 00:12:10	penthief	your sentences seem more tactical than anything else

2018-10-10 00:19:27	eyeoh	Hopefully I haven't thrown any accusations about, but if so, sorry.
2018-10-10 00:20:37	eyeoh	And if that last line is somehow also insincere, well I dunno what else I can offer.

2018-10-10 14:20:53	jmaister	[06:20:20] It usually doesn't get very cold here due to the gulf stream
2018-10-10 14:20:53	jmaister	[06:20:29] About -5°C on average in winter
2018-10-10 14:20:53	whomsoever	[06:20:53] yeah, we have a cold stream called Labrador stream that goes across our shore

2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:32:08] If you had asked me to take the area under an arbitrary curve before I started studying calculus (or indeed any of this math stuff recently) I would have simply drawn a polygon that approximates the curve and taken the area of that
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:32:15] Now I learn that's exactly what a Riemann sum is

2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:34:04] sunny Queensland
2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:34:25] also furrykef I recall integration being easier than differentiation when I did it in school too
2018-10-10 14:20:54	whomsoever	[06:34:47] oh yeah
2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:35:10] and we've gone over this before, but I too started with limits, then dy/dx and then integration - and I found it progressively easier; hence why I said what I said earlier about not worrying too much about getting the foundation perfect
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:35:11] furrykef, not even a polygon, just rectangles, but arbitrary small ones
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:35:12] I haven't had any difficulty with differentiation
2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:35:27] after you move forward, return to do limits again and it'll be clearer again
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:35:41] qed: well, the rectangles still form a polygon
2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:35:52] or just keep repeating and building on already learned knowledge I suppose
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:35:52] sure
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:35:55] And you can use trapezoids instead of pure rectangles if you like
2018-10-10 14:20:54	eyeoh	[06:36:08] ah yes trapezoids
2018-10-10 14:20:54	jmaister	[06:37:32] All math stuff left my head at the moment I left school
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:37:56] I'm a programmer and programming is a lot like math, really
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:38:04] Very similar kind of logical thinking
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:38:19] So I've apparently become rather more mathematically inclined over the years without really realizing it
2018-10-10 14:20:54	jmaister	[06:38:29] Me too, but it's also different
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:39] Wife sends her programmer husband grocery shopping
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:40] She tells him:
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:40] “I need butter, sugar and cooking oil. Also, get a loaf of bread and if they have eggs, get 6.”
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:40] The husband returns with the butter, sugar and cooking oil, as well as 6 loaves of bread.
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:40] The wife asks: “Why the hell did you get 6 loaves of bread?”
2018-10-10 14:20:54	qed	[06:38:41] To which the husband replies: “They had eggs.”
2018-10-10 14:20:54	jmaister	[06:38:44] In the way that you don't actually need or use calculus to program
2018-10-10 14:20:54	whomsoever	[06:38:59] furrykef: are you giving up on chess for maths now? O_o
2018-10-10 14:20:54	furrykef	[06:39:09] whomsoever: hell no
2018-10-10 14:20:54	whomsoever	[06:39:16] :D
2018-10-10 14:20:55	jmaister	[06:39:34] qed: She should have used paranthesis
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:39:56] Virtual Chess Coach is one of the only good ideas I've ever had. But I think I need a stronger mathematical background to do it justice. So I'm working on that.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[06:43:19] furrykef: what do you like to program with/in?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:43:27] I've had projects in the past where I tried to half-ass my way through things despite my lack of math knowledge. The results weren't too pretty. I want to avoid making the same mistake.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:43:43] eyeoh: I prefer programming in Python. Unfortunately none of Virtual Chess Coach uses Python at the moment
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:43:59] Some of it's in C++ and some of it's in HTML/JavaScript
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[06:44:19] do you find C++ yuck?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:47:07] yep.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:47:12] JavaScript too.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:47:25] But I follow the programmer's motto: use the right tool for the job.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	jmaister	[06:47:47] asm
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[06:49:57] ofc
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[06:50:47] I do have an odd fondness for 6502 ASM.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	jmaister	[06:51:40] I'm not even a programmer anymore
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:27:10] anyone wanna play a newb 10 0 unrated?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[09:28:39] nah.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:29:01] ok furrykef! rated :D ?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[09:30:07] nah.

2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:32:30] you are too busy with the math! i get it :P
2018-10-10 14:20:55	furrykef	[09:32:44] Sure, let's go with that.
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:45:38] haha I might be all chessed out for now
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:45:58] hmm not sure if storm will hit
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:46:04] but I guess I could go an unrated game emajor
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:46:10] !rating emajor rapid
2018-10-10 14:20:55	+botfisch`	[09:46:11] eyeoh: boomernang: rapid: 1245 (N=97, Δ=-76, σ=63)
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:47:24] eyeoh: you wanna?

2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:56:58] haha well done emajor
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:57:09] what a strange one; I've never played a game like that before
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:57:26] eyeoh: haha i traded so fast
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[09:57:40] one more?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[09:57:43] lets go 1 more
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:08:28] damn yo good
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:08:44] eyeoh: lucky!!! good game
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:09:00] lol why did you make your rating dip so much of late?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:09:16] you're no way under 1300
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:09:23] i just played like 30 minutes ago against a 900.// tried something different and got owned
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:09:28] lol
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:09:44] snap
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:09:58] what about since the end of september?
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:10:30] ill add you as a friend and you can look at profile.. nothing special
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:12:18] eyeoh: i havent played alot of games probably why
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:13:50] we'll have to play another time and see whether you repeat that "luck" as you call it, or if I manage to recover
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:14:06] so rekt right now after those two hah
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:14:34] sure! we will play heaps together
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:14:40] also who here is cryptographicsponge? I've forgotten
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:14:47] the first game was luck
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:15:10] I'm not so sure my tripled pawns were any use so you did well to force that
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:15:21] and gosh, so blocked on my left hand side/your right
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:15:29] that's never happened before lol
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:15:40] i was going to offer a draw but i thought try and reach the other side first with king
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:15:46] haha
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:15:52] my plan was to resign (kidding)
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:16:00] I thought we'd get locked into a draw
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:17:13] lol check out the analysis for first game.. you made a horrible blunder!
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:17:24] I have a feeling I know exactly where...
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:17:31] you didnt take my queen :O 
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:17:32] oh also yes, I left a piece hanging
2018-10-10 14:20:55	emajor	[10:17:34] i didnt even see that
2018-10-10 14:20:55	eyeoh	[10:17:34] WHAT
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:17:37] WHATTT
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:17:39] LOL
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:17:54] i just saw that now
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:18:37] holy hell
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:18:38] how the
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:19:07] that's incredible
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:19:15] that makes the victory more sweet i have to say
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:19:35] your magic knight must have pulled all the attention and made my own knight threatened
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:19:44] that's mentalism right there
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:20:03] the move right before, I knew to threaten your queen
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:20:29] and clearly you didn't see it so I tuned it out too once you moved your knight; amazeballs
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:20:52] so it was luck afterall
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:20:55] since i didnt see it
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:20:56] jesus
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:23:14] the analysis once we got down to pawns only is interesting
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:23:20] some deep calc going there that's beyond me
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:23:37] yeah earlier in the day I'd have seen you hang the queen
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:23:50] great recovery in that case!
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:24:10] now, let's see the 2nd game
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:24:55] it was one move that lost it in 1st game
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:25:00] you had a lot of inaccuracies but no blunders
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:25:53] dang sf hated 4...Nd7?!
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:25:57] I felt uneasy with that
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:27:33] yeah 11...d5?? was a blunder.
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:27:50] you won it right there by not letting me off it
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:28:41] was all attack after that
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:29:31] was fun though.. we will def play again :)
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:30:47] hah yeah
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:31:16] oh there was an interesting moment in the 2nd game but you handled it well
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:31:30] had you gone wrong it'd have been mate but you clearly saw it
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:31:55] it was a lucky last ditch effort
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:32:01] (would have been lucky)
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:32:20] where?
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:32:41] ohhh
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:32:50] around 18
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:33:52] actually nah you were safe
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:33:55] I'm seeing squares
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:34:03] but yeah 18 was as close I'd have ever got
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:35:14] ah you could have mated at 18
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:37:11] with so much time left on the clock both times we could have gone slower heh
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:37:40] that's true
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:38:53] It's remarkale how many mistakes are cut when time ends up being about 1 minute left at the end
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:39:27] I think the key is to not rush move 3 and 4 even though that's just the opening
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:40:20] moves 1 and 2 rarely seems to matter at this level, but after that the chances of inaccurracies followed by blunders increases
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:41:38] when i played qed i did the same thing.. traded and rushed for end game asap.. sort of a tactic i like against much higher level
2018-10-10 14:20:56	emajor	[10:41:48] he owned me tho
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:47:36] haha qed is a fair bit stronger than me
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:48:47] trading heaps and fast reminds me of something
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:52:57] trying to think of another sport or game where that kind of strategy is used with effectiveness
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:55:13] oh yes - football!
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:55:30] some weaker teams might just play super defense to take it to a penalty shootout
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:55:47] it's a part of the rules - so completely legit
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:56:37] it's really up to the 'stronger' player to neutralise that
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[10:57:11] I guess this is why agadmator and many others say practising the end game is so very important
2018-10-10 14:20:56	qed	[11:17:53] we really should have another channel tournament
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:18:03] we didn't even finish the last one
2018-10-10 14:20:56	qed	[11:18:05] but only with people who are willing to play all the rounds
2018-10-10 14:20:56	qed	[11:18:43] JimmyRustles, first prize an op, last place get banned
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:19:13] lol
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:19:17] looks like i'm getting banned then
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:19:46] i listed 4 of my chess sets on ebay
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:19:50] nobody's bidding though
2018-10-10 14:20:56	artefact	[11:22:43] everyone's an op already
2018-10-10 14:20:56	artefact	[11:22:45] there's no incentive to win
2018-10-10 14:20:56	artefact	[11:23:04] i'm looking for a compact travel set JimmyRustles, but that still has decent quality
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:24:33] i've got a travel set
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:24:39] it's nice but the pieces are too big for the squares
2018-10-10 14:20:56	+JimmyRustles	[11:24:42] so it's hard to play a game on it
2018-10-10 14:20:56	eyeoh	[11:54:08] yeah big pieces small square is sad

2018-10-10 16:22:35	Jik	oh my god
2018-10-10 16:22:40	Jik	norway chess 2019 doesn't have increment
2018-10-10 16:22:46	Jik	going back to dark middle ages it seems
2018-10-10 16:23:03	furrykef	What's the time control?
2018-10-10 16:23:12	+drakan	N+0 for life
2018-10-10 16:23:26	Jik	> 
2018-10-10 16:23:26	Jik	#NorwayChess 2019 June 3rd - 15th: Several new changes: TC 120 0, no increment or added time. If game drawn, 1 armageddon game. 2 points for win in main game, 1,5 for win in armageddon.
2018-10-10 16:23:51	furrykef	2 hours? Meh, increment's not a big deal.
2018-10-10 16:24:03	Jik	that's crazy short
2018-10-10 16:24:20	Jik	and without increment many will surely go into time trouble
2018-10-10 16:24:25	Garf	no increment is retarded imho
2018-10-10 16:24:27	Jik	and good games will be decided by blunders
2018-10-10 16:24:32	Garf	they had an incident with so last year
2018-10-10 16:24:45	Garf	miscounting the 40 move timecontrol by one move and blundering
2018-10-10 16:24:52	Garf	which cost magnus the victory, iirc
2018-10-10 16:25:05	Jik	well there's no 40 move limit any more so that's been taken care of.......
2018-10-10 16:25:29	furrykef	I like how you call 120+0 "crazy short" in an era where most of us play controls like 5+0
2018-10-10 16:29:29	artefact	120+0 is roughly 90+30. and many people will say 90+30 is a “proper” classical TC
2018-10-10 16:30:31	Jik	But 90+30 also put people in time trouble for >60 move games
2018-10-10 16:31:38	Jik	and 30 s/move gives a lot better endgamea for spectators than no increment

2018-10-10 17:16:33	qed	he got you bodies of the fallen soldiers from the korea war, that's much more than nothing
2018-10-10 17:17:02	furrykef	Somehow I don't think that's anywhere close to worth it
2018-10-10 17:17:38	artefact	he invented cars that can be remotely bricked if you look too closely at it. that's progress for you

2018-10-10 17:19:08	furrykef	I've never found the concept of DLC objectionable. It's what people do with it that's the problem
2018-10-10 17:21:07	+Momentum	he took a lot of unnecessary media attention in my opinion, but who cares about freaking media anyways
2018-10-10 17:23:14	+Momentum	"OMG this guys is really a mad genius, he dreams of living in other planets" aka people on youtube

2018-10-10 17:26:05	+Momentum	that's not something, that's a waste of money

2018-10-10 19:15:52	furrykef	Today's lichess puzzle of the day seems kinda lame. It's a good puzzle in and of itself but hardly worthy of "puzzle of the day" status.

2018-10-10 20:12:28	+Momentum	just a single game with white and rated? good game :)
2018-10-10 20:13:30	penthief	that was some clever pawn pushing
2018-10-10 20:14:10	+Momentum	i didn't have time turn that cleverness into a win though
2018-10-10 20:14:59	penthief	Yes, a winning position for black on move 29 according to the engine.
2018-10-10 20:15:37	penthief	All the way up to move 29
2018-10-10 20:16:32	+Momentum	i don't care about the engine evaluation, the position was winning before that move in my opinion
2018-10-10 20:18:00	+Momentum	aargh
2018-10-10 20:18:07	+Momentum	who wants to play? :)
2018-10-10 20:18:24	penthief	You pushed pawns to lock the position a couple of times. The old guys at the club tell me not to release the tension, but it seemed to work for you.
2018-10-10 20:18:36	penthief	I wonder what you know and I don't ;)
2018-10-10 20:19:26	+Momentum	you don't want to lock the position near your opponent's king, especially when you have the queens on the board
2018-10-10 20:20:09	+Momentum	exf3 is a very desirable move because it opens those lines
2018-10-10 20:21:39	+Momentum	i'd push e3 instead of exf3 if the queens were traded off, that way i have a passed pawn
2018-10-10 20:22:13	penthief	oic
2018-10-10 20:22:16	+Momentum	the decision about pawns is highly related to what pieces you have left in the board
2018-10-10 20:27:06	+Momentum	this is an example of a position where you have a very decisive advantage but the position is very sharp, if you don't have time to calculate you RIP

2018-10-10 23:56:16	furrykef	There aren't a lot of FICS clients, and the advent of lichess has reduced the already small demand
2018-10-10 23:56:31	furrykef	In fact, you can analyze with an engine at lichess too

2018-10-11 00:13:26	eyeoh	I guess one thing to do while waiting for opponent to return is to replay the game while it's still in progress
2018-10-11 00:13:38	Jik	mainly a database program but i recall it also has a fics feature
2018-10-11 00:14:42	eyeoh	Aren't there plenty of existing offline engines and clients? Only problem is they're not very good
2018-10-11 00:14:56	BoneTone	Jik: i'll look into those... I like the design of raptor-chess, but it requires java, which I'd prefer not to install, but may just for the interface as it is quite close to babas
2018-10-11 00:14:56	eyeoh	So lichess and stockfish won that battle
2018-10-11 00:15:16	eyeoh	What do you want? Something offline, that isn't stockfish?
2018-10-11 00:15:21	eyeoh	Why not stockfish?
2018-10-11 00:15:27	BoneTone	i have many engines

2018-10-11 00:17:05	eyeoh	Hmm 15+15 sure takes a while to time out but eh, I guess that's what I signed up for
2018-10-11 00:17:06	+Momentum	pychess is pretty good i think, i tried that on linuc
2018-10-11 00:17:09	+Momentum	linux*
2018-10-11 00:17:16	eyeoh	I tried psychess once
2018-10-11 00:17:22	eyeoh	Py
2018-10-11 00:17:36	+Momentum	it has fics and icc extension, and also you can add engines manually
2018-10-11 00:17:42	eyeoh	I might have even got it to work but after that I lost interest
2018-10-11 00:18:09	BoneTone	my question is why would you want to let someone else limit your option to only 1 engine?
2018-10-11 00:18:35	+Momentum	business?
2018-10-11 00:19:51	eyeoh	I don't see it as being limited. I spend my time on other things
2018-10-11 00:20:07	+Momentum	i mean of course if you want to use the engines you do, but you can't expect to find them everywhere
2018-10-11 00:20:11	eyeoh	If I focused everything on chess engines I'd get nothing else done

2018-10-11 00:20:41	 *	BoneTone doesn't focus everything on chess engines
2018-10-11 00:20:53	BoneTone	i've stated it quite clearly

2018-10-11 00:24:05	+Momentum	time to ban one of them furrykef :P
2018-10-11 00:24:06	eyeoh	I've only asked simple questions, take offense if you prefer

2018-10-11 00:25:27	penthief	emacs has a chess-mode which works ok with fics, but it all feels a bit unnatural
2018-10-11 00:25:37	eyeoh	Haha yes emacs
2018-10-11 00:25:41	penthief	i used raptor, which you've mentioned.
2018-10-11 00:25:51	BoneTone	penthief: yuck, i could never get comfortable in emacs, I'm a vim guy
2018-10-11 00:26:05	BoneTone	yeah, i've got raptor installed at the moment, but haven't installed the java dependencies yet
2018-10-11 00:26:23	+Momentum	all it takes to fics is: telnet fics.org 5000 or something
2018-10-11 00:26:41	BoneTone	xboard is an option i suppose, but i've always disliked its interface, i prefer the customizability of raptor and babas
2018-10-11 00:27:29	penthief	someone gave me tips for software here before, but i forgot their recommendations.
2018-10-11 00:27:30	BoneTone	heh, telnet in and play blind chess
2018-10-11 00:28:04	+Momentum	not necessarily they have a fine ASCII board
2018-10-11 00:28:17	BoneTone	i suppose i could run babas in an vm 
2018-10-11 00:28:59	+Momentum	why don't you want to give shit about pychess?
2018-10-11 00:29:00	BoneTone	what i'm really after is that customizability of interface, like babas & raptor, that supports fics & external engines
2018-10-11 00:29:18	BoneTone	i haven't looked at it yet, i'm not not giving a shit 
2018-10-11 00:29:48	BoneTone	i recall looking at it sometime back in 2017 and ending up not using it, but can't really even remember what it looked like
2018-10-11 00:30:34	BoneTone	yeah, looking at the screens on the website, that might be what i settle upon
2018-10-11 00:30:35	+Momentum	pretty sure it's customizable, and if you're good at python then life is easy
2018-10-11 00:30:42	BoneTone	not quite as customizable
2018-10-11 00:30:56	BoneTone	where you can lay window modules inside different panes
2018-10-11 00:31:28	BoneTone	from the screens it looks more like it spawns separate windows 
2018-10-11 00:31:56	+Momentum	from the screens it's not easy to judge :)
2018-10-11 00:32:14	BoneTone	then they need better screenshots
2018-10-11 00:32:58	eyeoh	Hmm
2018-10-11 00:33:09	eyeoh	One more game I think, but 10+0 only
2018-10-11 00:34:11	+Momentum	i'm afraid you're running out of options then

2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:33:37] good morning chess fans
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:35:04] goodmumble
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:35:35] This integral I'm working on is a bitch. It's a pretty simple one but I can't figure out the rule for integrating it.
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:38:17] what integral is it furrykef ?
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:38:28] It's a quiz, so I'm not gonna tell you :P
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:38:37] try integration by parts
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:39:54] when that stops working, try a variable change
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:40:21] oh, they call it substitution in english
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:40:48] u-substitution? Yeah, it's a u-substitution problem but I can't figure out how to actually do it in this particular case
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:40:52] In any case I don't want hints
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:41:11] One would think you guys woulda figured that out by now, heh
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:41:41] and yet you keep talking about it on this very public channel
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:41:47] (and one would think I woulda learned to keep my trap shut)
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:41:50] tip, if you don't want help on something, don't talk about it here
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:42:08] Why is it so hard to respect a guy's wishes?
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:42:33] furrykef: ask brett kavanaugh
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:42:40] what kind of replies are you expecting, then? or maybe you think this channel is your twitter feed?
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:42:49] Maybe I'm rubber ducking
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:43:22] I need to start latexing,  I don't want to start latexing,  conclusion: more coffee needed
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:43:33] I don't have this problem in other channels I'm in
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:43:53] is that a subtle way of telling we're the problem?
2018-10-11 06:48:52	artefact	[06:44:03] anyway, i have to go to work. bye!
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:44:04] I dunno about subtle, but yes
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:44:08] lol
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:46:27] did you solve it? did you solve it?
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:46:32] I will ask every minute
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:46:34] nope
2018-10-11 06:48:52	 *	qed-office [06:46:37] try to be more annoying
2018-10-11 06:48:52	qed-office	[06:46:52] *tries
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:46:56] Think I may have gotten lead of some kind on it
2018-10-11 06:48:52	furrykef	[06:47:09] very close to giving up, though

2018-10-11 13:23:48	furrykef	[06:56:25] Think I've had a breakthrough...
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:57:49] hmm people who run away when in a losing position to let the clock go to zero
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:58:37] 05:42:08 <furrykef> Why is it so hard to respect a guy's wishes?
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:58:42] cause it's kind of baiting
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:58:45] but that's a harsh way to put it
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:58:59] the thing is, it's annoying when there's a tidbit of information - it's human nature to want to know more
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:59:07] you dangle a carrot, we become interested
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[06:59:47] or to put it nicely, we're always interested in what you're up to
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[07:00:40] anyway, I've managed to scrape together a win after a 7 game losing streak so yay

2018-10-11 13:23:48	qed-office	[07:01:26] hi there eyeoh , hope you are having a nice day
2018-10-11 13:23:48	 *	furrykef [07:02:04] throws keyboard
2018-10-11 13:23:48	furrykef	[07:02:10] all that time on this one problem and I get it wrong.
2018-10-11 13:23:48	qed-office	[07:02:24] the life of the mathematician, get used to it :)
2018-10-11 13:23:48	qed-office	[07:02:45] it happens to people who work on a problem for several years
2018-10-11 13:23:48	qed-office	[07:02:46] lol
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[07:03:03] (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[07:03:12] you need that /completion ;)
2018-10-11 13:23:48	eyeoh	[07:03:32] my day is going well; bit rainy outside but feels comfortable
2018-10-11 13:23:48	furrykef	[07:03:55] The problem is (let's see if I can make this work in ASCII): int x/(1+2x^2)^2 dx
2018-10-11 13:23:48	furrykef	[07:04:51] I got up to 1/4 int 1/u^2 du and didn't know how to proceed from there
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:05:03] Seems the problem was I forgot about negative exponents
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:05:18] sigh. So it was something dead simple after all
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:10:04] Huh... actually I think I get the same result as I got by trying to apply the quotient rule (that was the breakthrough I thought I had). I must have screwed up at a later step.
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:17:12] oh, that's heartbreaking
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:17:16] I screwed it up right at the end
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[07:17:47] I had -1/36 + 1/4 and somehow I'd missed the -
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:09:20] furrykef: when you see such thing you automatically think ln() of something
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:09:37] oh sorry not ln
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:09:39] you have ()^@
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:09:41] you have ()^2
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:09:54] yeah, I was trying to figure out how to make it work with ln too
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:10:08] you see I give you bad advice
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:10:12] :P
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:10:15] you can't say that I help you
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:10:17] or spoil
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:10:19] pfft.
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:11:59] so you have an x on top thus your first guess is 1/(1+2x^2) and then you need to adjust it a bit so it will work by adding appropriate constants
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:12:20] I know how to do it now, but thanks.
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:12:21] multiplicative constants that is
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:12:44] furrykef: in a month or two it will be automatical for you
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:13:02] I don't know how much calculus I will be doing in a month or two
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:13:21] I'm not taking math courses at a university or anything
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:14:04] I'll probably have finished this course in a few days
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:15:24] :(
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:15:44] Do remember I have a Virtual Chess Coach to write :P
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:16:31] study one year before you start it
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:16:58] Erm, I hope to be wrapping up the first release about a year from now...
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:17:09] I gotta put food on the table, dude
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:19:17] money is the least important thing in the world
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:19:28] Not when you can't eat without it
2018-10-11 13:23:49	qed-office	[08:20:13] sad but true
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:36:23] Tomorrow I'll be starting on differential equations. Or maybe taking the day off, I don't know
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:48:33] Khan Academy is encouraging bad habits
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:48:50] You don't have to type the + C after the solved integral; it adds it for you
2018-10-11 13:23:49	furrykef	[08:49:44] And I keep forgetting the integral of 1/x is ln |x|, not ln(x), but I don't get penalized for forgetting because the answers for these questions have usually been multiple-choice

2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:37:35] you almost had me
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:37:53] look at my collection of pieces

2018-10-11 13:23:50	emajor	[11:39:42] worst blunder of my life not taking your queen ..24

2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:42:03] ah you didn't want to lose your knight
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:42:11] I was wondering why you captured with knight

2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:42:59] what a fascinating game this chess thing is
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:43:04] don't even need crazyhouse
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:43:52] so yeah the takeback things don't make any pings and are grey on grey text
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:44:06] kind of more funny without
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:46:32] I can't get over how well made this lichess website is (even though it's not perfect)
2018-10-11 13:23:50	eyeoh	[11:46:58] the android app still needs a little work though; I should report some bugs or check if there are open ones

2018-10-11 15:19:04	+Momentum	so the current implementations use sha2?
2018-10-11 15:19:10	artefact	or maybe not. sha1 is considered broken, yet most pgp fingerprints are still sha1
2018-10-11 15:19:32	+Momentum	it doesn't matter that much i guess for a pgp key
2018-10-11 15:19:44	artefact	what are you smoking? of course it does
2018-10-11 15:20:42	+Momentum	wait? fingerprints
2018-10-11 15:20:48	+Momentum	okay
2018-10-11 15:21:16	eyeoh	as far as I know, pgp fingerprints are just to confirm a public key
2018-10-11 15:21:28	artefact	in keysigning parties, people don't exchange their public keys. they exchange fingerprints
2018-10-11 15:21:35	artefact	and later, at home, they fetch, and sign, public keys using keyservers
2018-10-11 15:21:50	+Momentum	yes i mean public key
2018-10-11 15:22:23	artefact	if it's trivial to forge a key with a given fingerprint, you can poison keyservers with fake public keys
2018-10-11 15:22:25	eyeoh	if there's a collision, you'll see it on the public server
2018-10-11 15:22:33	artefact	and the whole system collapses
2018-10-11 15:23:03	eyeoh	no big loss; there's not a lot of people in the strong set
2018-10-11 15:23:06	eyeoh	just make a new pgp
2018-10-11 15:23:16	eyeoh	revoke, and publish new keys
2018-10-11 15:23:29	artefact	you are missing the point.
2018-10-11 15:23:39	eyeoh	continue..
2018-10-11 15:23:46	artefact	also, key signing parties don't happen every day. it's kind of a pain to get in the strong set.
2018-10-11 15:24:19	eyeoh	you can say that about PGP even without keysigning parties
2018-10-11 15:24:58	eyeoh	I'm inclined to go with Momentum here and say it doesn't really matter that much
2018-10-11 15:25:08	eyeoh	like what's the worse that could happen?
2018-10-11 15:25:43	+Momentum	he's talking about poisoning keyservers i guess
2018-10-11 15:25:53	eyeoh	keyservers are already a mess heh
2018-10-11 15:25:58	eyeoh	just look at satoshi nakamoto

2018-10-11 15:27:04	eyeoh	more recently there was an issue with some mail software's handling of PGP
2018-10-11 15:27:13	eyeoh	gnupg itself was fine
2018-10-11 15:28:03	eyeoh	so I'm wondering, even if sha1 is completely broken (and not a one off collision example), perhaps the software end could do extra mitigation and continue to keep sha1 fingerprints and the existing public keys

2018-10-11 15:31:10	eyeoh	(in case I ever get "important"...)
2018-10-11 15:31:23	+drakan	i've decided to go the other direction... i want to get as close to anonymous as i can
2018-10-11 15:31:28	eyeoh	Richard Stallman meanwhile refuses to publish to keyservers.
2018-10-11 15:31:36	eyeoh	there's no rule that says you must
2018-10-11 15:31:51	eyeoh	there's also no hard rule that says you must trust ultimately in person (what if passports are forged?)
2018-10-11 15:32:02	eyeoh	Rutkowska tells people to trust her keys ultimately
2018-10-11 15:32:11	+drakan	where do you get a forged passport ?
2018-10-11 15:32:14	eyeoh	the instructions at pgp.net or wherever it is are vague

2018-10-11 15:32:52	eyeoh	however in the case of keysigning parties; not everybody has a passport
2018-10-11 15:32:58	eyeoh	driver licenses might suffice for some
2018-10-11 15:33:00	eyeoh	but how real are they?
2018-10-11 15:33:07	eyeoh	what if I'm a spy to my friends?
2018-10-11 15:33:08	artefact	most parties accept any form of gvt issued ID
2018-10-11 15:33:23	eyeoh	yeah until not that long ago, my state had paper laminated driver licences
2018-10-11 15:33:43	eyeoh	and imagine if you were travelling internationally; who would know what a fake looked like
2018-10-11 15:33:48	artefact	my driver license is pink paper. paper.
2018-10-11 15:34:14	eyeoh	yeah so while it's commonly agreed that keysigning parties are the way to go, they're not the only way
2018-10-11 15:34:25	eyeoh	(s/keysigning parties/meeting in person)
2018-10-11 15:34:33	eyeoh	Rutkowska for example...

2018-10-11 15:35:31	eyeoh	that's a little different to people I guess but still
2018-10-11 15:35:37	eyeoh	it depends on how the PGP keys are used
2018-10-11 15:36:00	eyeoh	most linux dev is just for proof of authorship
2018-10-11 15:36:07	eyeoh	and not so much secret messaging

2018-10-11 15:40:36	eyeoh	what did I write?
2018-10-11 15:40:47	eyeoh	is there a utility or algorithm to decrypt it?
2018-10-11 15:40:58	artefact	sha1 is not a cipher. do you ever learn?

2018-10-11 15:41:12	eyeoh	rude
2018-10-11 15:42:21	eyeoh	hmm interesting thought though
2018-10-11 15:42:41	eyeoh	people do use it a cipher of sorts - for passwords
2018-10-11 15:43:07	eyeoh	which of course makes short passwords a bad idea
2018-10-11 15:43:13	Jik	no it's  not "a cipher of sorts" for passwords, the whole point of using it is that the password shouldn't be recoverable.
2018-10-11 15:43:16	eyeoh	but that doesn't make longer passphrases busted
2018-10-11 15:43:34	eyeoh	well it wouldn't be recoverable if it weren't for leaks
2018-10-11 15:43:42	eyeoh	and rainbow tables
2018-10-11 15:44:02	artefact	not really if you use a proper KDF
2018-10-11 15:44:37	eyeoh	theoretically, you could compute quite large sets of information into sha1 hashes, and from that, work out what information belongs to what hash
2018-10-11 15:44:48	eyeoh	almost like a compression algorithm
2018-10-11 15:45:00	eyeoh	But what would I know
2018-10-11 15:45:05	artefact	basic maths says no
2018-10-11 15:45:17	eyeoh	leaked password databases says yes
2018-10-11 15:45:43	artefact	a password isn't a large set of information
2018-10-11 15:45:44	eyeoh	https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords enter a simple password and this will look up the hash, not the password
2018-10-11 15:45:59	eyeoh	but passwords are a common bad implementation for it
2018-10-11 15:46:17	eyeoh	maybe it'd be easier if we just dig up the sha1-is-busted link
2018-10-11 15:46:23	eyeoh	I did read something of that a while ago
2018-10-11 15:46:46	eyeoh	But you're implying I'm not capable of learning which, okay
2018-10-11 15:47:22	eyeoh	"In 2017 CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash.[14][15][16]" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1 and what else?
2018-10-11 15:48:07	eyeoh	oh there's even a branded site https://shattered.io (of course there is)
2018-10-11 15:49:15	eyeoh	so to date it appears there's still only the pdf proof of concept
2018-10-11 15:49:52	eyeoh	"Has this been abused in the wild?" 'Not as far as we know.' - which of course also would require some sort of critical dependence on it
2018-10-11 15:50:08	penthief	I never understood why they used PDF files. Did they have to be PDF files? Did that make it easier for some reason?
2018-10-11 15:50:21	eyeoh	because it's not fully busted... and pdf was the easiest thing for them to do maybe
2018-10-11 15:50:44	eyeoh	hmm do people sha1sum pdf files?
2018-10-11 15:51:26	artefact	having two files that are readable pdf files makes it somewhat harder
2018-10-11 15:51:40	eyeoh	for things that matter (like linux distros), they already provide sha256 hashes
2018-10-11 15:51:41	artefact	only somewhat, because you can stuff arbitrary data inside pdf files with ease
2018-10-11 15:51:43	penthief	Just think, these PDFs will be the most sha1summed PDF files in existence.
2018-10-11 15:51:50	eyeoh	so whatever problem there is with sha1, isn't a problem for linux distros
2018-10-11 15:52:09	eyeoh	penthief: haha
2018-10-11 15:52:26	eyeoh	all for nought because it's just onto the next sha now
2018-10-11 15:52:33	eyeoh	I still use md5sum
2018-10-11 15:52:45	eyeoh	e.g.: when I want to compare two unimportant files
2018-10-11 15:52:46	eyeoh	it's fast
2018-10-11 15:52:50	+MagnusRM	you could as easily have done it with two text files, but i guess they did it with pdf-files since that gives a strong impression of what they want to show
2018-10-11 15:53:28	eyeoh	and then there's "hardened sha-1". I don't know what that is
2018-10-11 15:54:24	artefact	if you think modern hashes are cpu-bound, you're wrong
2018-10-11 15:54:25	eyeoh	btw, Moxie thinks PGP is completely useless now
2018-10-11 15:54:30	eyeoh	although he calls it GPG
2018-10-11 15:54:33	artefact	you'll be i/o bound way before cpu becomes the bottleneck
2018-10-11 15:55:08	eyeoh	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9104188 - unfortunately, his alternative - Signal - isn't that perfect yet from a usability standpoint
2018-10-11 15:55:22	eyeoh	the app is.. a bit bare - and it's not really available on linux properly yet
2018-10-11 15:55:28	eyeoh	you gotta download a 1GB flatpak
2018-10-11 15:55:38	eyeoh	and that's not exactly trustable is it?
2018-10-11 15:55:39	artefact	signal is nowhere close to a gpg alternative
2018-10-11 15:55:49	eyeoh	I don't disagree there
2018-10-11 15:55:53	artefact	for once, it requires you to give a phone number. for two, you don't even handle your own key material
2018-10-11 15:55:54	eyeoh	but check out moxie's words
2018-10-11 15:56:14	artefact	three, no WoT. four, no signing/ciphering of files, etc
2018-10-11 15:56:29	artefact	only thing it has going for it is user friendliness. ultimately at the cost of security
2018-10-11 15:56:34	eyeoh	therefore, I argue that sha1 pgp fingerprints isn't a major problem in practice.
2018-10-11 15:56:55	eyeoh	there are other issues to contend with with pgp - namely "so I share my private key right?"
2018-10-11 15:57:08	eyeoh	(apparently that's an faq)
2018-10-11 15:57:28	eyeoh	I think Wire is a nicer service all-round
2018-10-11 15:57:42	eyeoh	but for most people, they find Facebook Messenger or even Google Hangouts easier
2018-10-11 15:57:44	eyeoh	or WhatsApp
2018-10-11 15:57:44	artefact	gnupg calls them secret keys, not private. it's a non-issue. if users are stupid, it's their fault
2018-10-11 15:57:55	eyeoh	there you go again
2018-10-11 15:58:29	eyeoh	but that's almost in agreement with me suggesting sha1 fingerprints are a non-issue
2018-10-11 15:58:32	artefact	and i do believe sha1 fingerprints are weak. it's why all modern browsers mark sha1-only tls certificates as insecure/deprecated
2018-10-11 15:58:44	eyeoh	well that's a different use case
2018-10-11 15:58:53	eyeoh	of course browsers need something better now
2018-10-11 15:58:58	eyeoh	but does pgp and git?
2018-10-11 15:59:05	eyeoh	dunno; so far it seems okay
2018-10-11 15:59:17	eyeoh	and one day sha256 will also be broken

2018-10-11 16:00:09	eyeoh	bah fedora website still is not good
2018-10-11 16:00:51	artefact	the git usecase of sha1 is completely different. i don't get why you're bringing it out now
2018-10-11 16:02:14	eyeoh	because https://shattered.io brought it up
2018-10-11 16:02:45	eyeoh	you said "sha1 is already busted" so I went to the source
2018-10-11 16:02:59	eyeoh	and they mention hypotheticals like git and pgp
2018-10-11 16:04:14	eyeoh	I wanted to delve into what "busted" precisely meant
2018-10-11 16:04:29	eyeoh	consider this - hypothetically:
2018-10-11 16:04:30	eyeoh	e$h-xAJT_P9HAHM,
2018-10-11 16:04:36	eyeoh	oh carp; my password has been busted

2018-10-11 16:05:24	eyeoh	that alone isn't really busted if it's of no practical use

2018-10-11 16:06:15	eyeoh	I see people in my city fishing for carp sometimes

2018-10-11 16:06:39	+notzmv	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_carp this one goes to 50 kgs
2018-10-11 16:07:29	eyeoh	did you know that Catla is similar to the word Katla
2018-10-11 16:07:36	eyeoh	Katla being that volcano in Iceland
2018-10-11 16:07:55	eyeoh	not to be confused with Eyjafjallajo(umlaut)kull
2018-10-11 16:08:30	eyeoh	Eyjafjallajökull
2018-10-11 16:13:44	eyeoh	I love how inconsistent distros are with their checksums. fedora has sha256sum and gpg thingo; ubuntun has md5sums, sha1sums, sha256sums, gpg
2018-10-11 16:13:58	eyeoh	and the instructions have different procedures too
2018-10-11 16:14:28	artefact	different people do different things? who'd have guessed.
2018-10-11 16:15:00	eyeoh	well md5 being even weaker than sha1; kind of interesting
2018-10-11 16:15:12	eyeoh	it's of course faster, but I don't think by much
2018-10-11 16:15:14	artefact	md5 is still fine for integrity. it's not for authenticity
2018-10-11 16:15:30	artefact	same reason adler32/crc32 are used in network protocols/filesystems
2018-10-11 16:15:38	eyeoh	http://releases.ubuntu.com/bionic/ see all the options
2018-10-11 16:16:00	eyeoh	why do they have three there?
2018-10-11 16:16:29	eyeoh	is it like "oh ok, today I might pick the sha1sum one instead of md5 or sha256"
2018-10-11 16:17:57	eyeoh	https://getfedora.org/static/checksums/Fedora-Workstation-28-1.1-x86_64-CHECKSUM fedora simply gives you one option
2018-10-11 16:18:27	eyeoh	*purses lips* let's take a look at qubes...

2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[06:16:08] "never play f6"
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[06:16:17] Annnnd I finger slipped https://lichess.org/cLWelvCN
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[06:39:20] And massively blundered at the end
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:52:50] Subway Sandwich Artists' cash register computer offline and not rebooting ("it literally takes 45 minutes - everything is down"). Scored free foot long sub.
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:53:05] they have no paper ledger it seems
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:53:33] needs more blockchain /s
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:54:27] I did offer cash but declined
2018-10-12 13:57:06	emajor	[07:55:36] eyeoh: wtf! i just got subway they are around hte corner
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:55:51] I'm behind you
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:56:03] did your subway transaction work?
2018-10-12 13:57:06	emajor	[07:56:32] yes but ive got a free sub after 3 more.. got the card and everything
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:56:46] wow no cards at my place
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:56:53] I used to have one
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:57:39] I find it remarkable how large corporations such as woolworths have no paper backup capability
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:57:56] so instead opt to close stores during glitches
2018-10-12 13:57:06	furrykef	[07:58:50] If it costs less that way, that's how they'll do it
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:58:51] I bet they could manage without internet, but they don't have the qualified bookkeepers to record transactions
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[07:58:57] ^ yea

2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:07:43] don't know the story
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:07:59] as for thread topic; why do people even reddit
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:08:06] just play
2018-10-12 13:57:06	artefact	[09:15:41] haha. i made 5 huge blunders yesterday. it's a miracle i even won
2018-10-12 13:57:06	artefact	[09:17:13] hopefully i play better sunday
2018-10-12 13:57:06	Garf	[09:34:38] eyeoh: random IM who wrote some book appears to be a total nutcase
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:35:53] eh yeah not worth giving the time of day to
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[09:35:58] eyeoh: use reddit to look at memes https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:36:25] yeah I guess reddit is okay for that kind of time wasting, but not for 'serious' effort given the whole system is anti-thought
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:36:47] my experience there has been, write something not even controversial - just opinion based on facts; downvotes/buried
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[09:36:53] yup
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:36:56] stuff like using WD-40 on my bicycle chain
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:36:59] it's not even political
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:37:28] stuff like "I've been doing an experiment with WD-40 to check whether it really is as bad as people say" BAM DOWNVOTES
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:37:45] which would be fine if it didn't completely bury the comment; so it's not worth writing in the first place
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:38:07] and such are the rules; fair enough - I'll play by them; by not wasting any more time
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[09:38:55] haha I chuckled at https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/comments/9nb0h4/every_time_my_opponent_responds_to_e4_with_e6/
2018-10-12 13:57:06	Garf	[09:41:32] hey im learning the french
2018-10-12 13:57:06	Garf	[09:41:37] mostly because I hate playing against it
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[09:41:48] aaah the french
2018-10-12 13:57:06	furrykef	[09:41:54] Sounds more like a reason to play 1.d4 to me
2018-10-12 13:57:06	 *	furrykef [09:41:56] runs
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[09:42:16] D4 is GOAT
2018-10-12 13:57:06	furrykef	[09:42:26] no ur a goat
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[09:42:34] thanks
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:01:04] play a3
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:01:23] or do what I did accidentally today; 1...f6
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:01:47] I thought it was g6; and got so confused and wondered if I was playing 960 or something
2018-10-12 13:57:06	mursu	[10:01:48] but I'm not good enough to play a3 :(
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:02:11] I was wondering 'what.. is my king supposed to be there?'
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:02:25] 'did someone set up my lichessboard wrong?'
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:02:44] worst part is that I should have won that game too but hunt my bishop at the end
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:02:53] hung*; thought it was guarded or something
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:53:52] hurrah I finally played a good rapid - made 0 blunders, and made sure to punish the 1 blunder my opponent made just before the end https://lichess.org/YQ1O16xA/black
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[10:53:59] can retire for the night now
2018-10-12 13:57:06	emajor	[11:00:36] eyeoh: not retiring.. we are playing soon
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:06:08] I kind of need to do an assignment except I dunno if anything meaningful can be submitted in 2 hours
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:06:11] :/
2018-10-12 13:57:06	emajor	[11:06:45] eyeoh: what are you studying?
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:07:02] IT of course like everyone else on freenode
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:07:10] or java and uml this term
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:07:20] how about after 12:00 GMT
2018-10-12 13:57:06	eyeoh	[11:07:29] or 23:00 AEDT
2018-10-12 13:57:06	emajor	[11:08:24] what do you prefer.. programming or  networking?
2018-10-12 13:57:07	emajor	[11:08:27] done ccna?
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:08:45] nah no certs yet
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:09:24] I'll do some once I stop not-focusing on uni
2018-10-12 13:57:07	emajor	[11:09:48] oh so ccna isnt apart of the course?
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:25:36] nup, it's just RMIT via OUA
2018-10-12 13:57:07	emajor	[11:28:30] eyeoh: cool. you have to be strong to do a degree like that online... without a class structure you need to be disciplined 
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:28:45] yeah it's admittedly not easy to be disciplined
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:29:14] but I'm determined to get it done eventually (hopefully no later than 2021..)
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:29:34] my smarter brother keeps throwing me ideas about doing this or that private full stack course
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:29:41] but there's no guarantee they'd be any better either
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:30:08] at least with OUA, it's under HECS so that debt isn't really important (unlike poor Americans and their tertiary studies)
2018-10-12 13:57:07	emajor	[11:30:17] fuck private imo :D rmit is great
2018-10-12 13:57:07	eyeoh	[11:55:09] yeah I'm confident I can make something out of it even if others are more jaded

2018-10-12 14:07:59	+Momentum	so g6 was a premove?
2018-10-12 14:08:33	eyeoh	both 1 and 2
2018-10-12 14:08:54	eyeoh	1...g6, 2...Bg7
2018-10-12 14:09:06	+Momentum	g6 was fine
2018-10-12 14:09:16	+Momentum	Bg7 RIP
2018-10-12 14:09:19	eyeoh	if I'm going to do that I really should go Nf6 first..
2018-10-12 14:09:21	eyeoh	I KNOW
2018-10-12 14:09:46	eyeoh	I saw out of the corner of my eye that he played b3 but ehh hardly anyone does that to me as white
2018-10-12 14:10:00	eyeoh	didn't even look to see his bishop coming out
2018-10-12 14:10:13	eyeoh	fortunately he later hung his rook to a similar thing
2018-10-12 14:10:28	eyeoh	My plan was to resign...
2018-10-12 14:10:33	eyeoh	but figured let's practise some traps
2018-10-12 14:11:03	+Momentum	never resign against a 1300
2018-10-12 14:11:13	eyeoh	haha yeah
2018-10-12 14:11:20	prsstnt	do you think it's possible for someone that sucks at chess to make a chess engine?
2018-10-12 14:11:26	eyeoh	yes
2018-10-12 14:11:45	prsstnt	sweet
2018-10-12 14:12:01	eyeoh	Momentum: I saw Ben Finegold destroying opponents after hanging most of his own pieces
2018-10-12 14:12:23	eyeoh	I think not even in 1 minute, but in 5
2018-10-12 14:12:36	eyeoh	looks like I could have trapped my last opponent's bishop better too
2018-10-12 14:13:14	+Momentum	prsstnt: i know many of them who have very strong engines but they are not chess players
2018-10-12 14:13:35	eyeoh	interestingly after he hung his rook, I was still well behind
2018-10-12 14:14:01	+Momentum	of course
2018-10-12 14:14:05	eyeoh	I think my queen on the first rank applied some pressure even if that wasn't the thing to do
2018-10-12 14:14:17	+Momentum	you're down a piece at that moment
2018-10-12 14:14:59	eyeoh	at 21, he forgot about the fork threat and was focused on bishop
2018-10-12 14:15:05	eyeoh	could see my rook rise
2018-10-12 14:15:31	eyeoh	and I was premoving capture backs there but wow, Bishop f1
2018-10-12 14:16:16	eyeoh	happy I didn't blunder the end game
2018-10-12 14:16:58	eyeoh	all the inaccuracies and mistakes don't feel as bad as one blunder
2018-10-12 14:18:25	+Momentum	what matters is what you think is a blunder not what SF thinks is a blunder
2018-10-12 14:19:13	+Momentum	and what also matters is if you think you can recover the position, not if SF thinks you can recover the position
2018-10-12 14:19:44	+Momentum	SF would have resigned 10 moves earlier, but you knew you were playing a 1300
2018-10-12 14:20:07	eyeoh	hah yeah
2018-10-12 14:20:27	eyeoh	most of the time I can see my blunders just before my opponent moves
2018-10-12 14:20:44	eyeoh	and then just gotta hope the opponent thinks I was trying something more crafty and blunders themselves
2018-10-12 14:21:04	eyeoh	especially if I don't think too much after a blunder and just keep moving
2018-10-12 14:21:10	eyeoh	'this is fine'
2018-10-12 14:21:39	eyeoh	your ultrabullet rating is so much higher than bullet and rapid
2018-10-12 14:21:49	eyeoh	and blitz*
2018-10-12 14:21:53	+Momentum	there's a good trick i used to do to avoid that, when i think of a move i drag the piece to that square without dropping it and i see the how the position looks like after that, if i don't see anything immediate i drop the piece, most of the time i see my opponent reply and drag the piece back
2018-10-12 14:22:00	eyeoh	do you play otb?
2018-10-12 14:22:14	+Momentum	no, i played like once or twice only
2018-10-12 14:22:17	eyeoh	hmm yeah I haven't been dragging cause mostly touchpad
2018-10-12 14:22:19	eyeoh	or phone
2018-10-12 14:22:26	eyeoh	I haven't actually played on my desktop with mouse yet
2018-10-12 14:22:42	eyeoh	drag move is definitely superior (with mouse)
2018-10-12 14:23:06	eyeoh	I see finegold and john bartholomew's mousing/thinking
2018-10-12 14:23:14	eyeoh	really fascinating how often they change their minds
2018-10-12 14:23:23	+Momentum	also the flip the board technique is also useful to see your opponents moves better
2018-10-12 14:23:45	+Momentum	if you are a beginner of course, because you have to learn to do that without flipping the board
2018-10-12 14:23:56	eyeoh	I notice how different that perspective is in the 'learn from your (opponent's) mistakes' feature

2018-10-12 14:25:07	+Momentum	i don't see that feature very useful to be honest, i prefer to rewind the game without engine
2018-10-12 14:25:53	+Momentum	unless someone says OMG turn on that freaking engine there's something amazing
2018-10-12 14:25:53	eyeoh	it just looks like puzzles to me
2018-10-12 14:26:20	eyeoh	I tend to look at the engine blunder list first though
2018-10-12 14:26:46	eyeoh	prsstnt: anyone who can program can make an engine - the question is whether it'd be any good..
2018-10-12 14:27:05	eyeoh	you're most likely not going to make a stockfish competitor solo
2018-10-12 14:27:24	eyeoh	but I imagine you could figure out your own, before moving onto an existing (or even new) project
2018-10-12 14:27:31	eyeoh	and then get team members on
2018-10-12 14:27:37	+Momentum	the question of whether it'd be any good also has nothing to do with how much chess you know

2018-10-12 14:28:06	eyeoh	well, they are with computer go
2018-10-12 14:28:54	+Momentum	the question is about chess from a CS prespective is just yet another graph searching problem
2018-10-12 14:29:24	eyeoh	definitely a fascinating one, and one that programming tutors tend not encourage immediately, at least not before more simple games
2018-10-12 14:30:40	+Momentum	too much bullet actually destroyed my chess

2018-10-12 14:33:35	eyeoh	I think I'm still moving way too quickly in 15+15 - not even real classical, but we'll call it that cause lichess is god
2018-10-12 14:33:58	eyeoh	my last classical took about 20 minutes all up I think
2018-10-12 14:34:08	eyeoh	so still heaps of time remaining
2018-10-12 14:34:26	eyeoh	a few seconds longer on each move could cut inaccuracies drastically
2018-10-12 14:34:37	eyeoh	so goes the theory
2018-10-12 14:34:57	eyeoh	but oh my I'm never going to make that rook hang blunder on move 2 again...
2018-10-12 14:35:37	eyeoh	never play f3/f6, and never premove to blunder a rook to a bishop from b2

2018-10-12 14:53:14	eyeoh	and then they declined and hung their queen?

2018-10-12 14:54:17	eyeoh	walking into double check
2018-10-12 14:54:31	+Momentum	obviously a mouseslip
2018-10-12 14:54:38	eyeoh	but to where
2018-10-12 14:54:48	eyeoh	Qh4?
2018-10-12 14:54:48	+Momentum	what do you mean?
2018-10-12 14:55:10	eyeoh	Qg3
2018-10-12 14:55:27	eyeoh	oh no, arrow says Qg5
2018-10-12 14:55:32	+Momentum	Qg3 or Qg5 are both possible
2018-10-12 14:55:58	+drakan	i always feel bad when my opponent resigns and then i look and i missed mate
2018-10-12 14:56:31	eyeoh	hmm wonder what Qg3 is like vs Qg5
2018-10-12 14:56:44	+Momentum	do you think you can stand this 1400 eyeoh https://lichess.org/6dtLIDL91rPf

2018-10-12 14:57:25	eyeoh	I didn't see mate in 1
2018-10-12 14:57:49	eyeoh	so I forced repetition draw
2018-10-12 14:58:00	eyeoh	tbh I didn't see that my bishop was guarding rook
2018-10-12 14:58:11	eyeoh	and I still had 3 minutes left!
2018-10-12 14:58:22	eyeoh	should have spent a minute to decide whether I really wanted a draw
2018-10-12 14:58:57	eyeoh	dude called me a coward heh
2018-10-12 14:59:02	+drakan	yeah i saw you post it yesterday lol

2018-10-12 15:44:12	+drakan	yes, thanks for the games
2018-10-12 15:44:20	+drakan	i dont hate g3 as much as you do
2018-10-12 15:44:36	+drakan	are light squares that much better for white ?
2018-10-12 15:45:15	+Momentum	light squares are important for sure, but a king side attack for black was kinda far fetched too
2018-10-12 15:45:59	+Momentum	i'd have do things like b6 Bb7 stuff

2018-10-12 15:46:43	+Momentum	i mean that's the only possible way to successfuly develop my light squared bishop
2018-10-12 15:46:55	+drakan	that seems like more reason why g3 is ok ?
2018-10-12 15:47:35	+Momentum	b6 Bb7 is just how to refute g3
2018-10-12 15:48:30	+drakan	but you weren't inclined to b6 Bb7 :)
2018-10-12 15:48:35	+Momentum	of course i'm not saying g3 is immediatly losing because black has problems himself
2018-10-12 15:48:53	+Momentum	yeah, that's true, black had some problems to deal with obviously
2018-10-12 15:49:14	+drakan	i am looking for more understanding of broader theory here because i don't understand your view
2018-10-12 15:49:34	+drakan	it's only meh to me because it's relatively neutral
2018-10-12 15:49:44	+drakan	it's a crappy way to have to develop my queenside minors
2018-10-12 15:50:03	+drakan	Be3 there really sucks for example, when i've already stacked queen and rook
2018-10-12 15:50:12	+drakan	https://lichess.org/hul43wQvLKtC for those at home :)
2018-10-12 15:50:20	+drakan	around move 12

2018-10-12 15:52:42	+drakan	only to weaken your queenside
2018-10-12 15:52:52	+drakan	i felt awkward because we had so many minors but felt ok because your light bishop was stuck

2018-10-12 19:25:13	prsstnt	hi
2018-10-12 19:25:26	prsstnt	what's the maximum number of moves a board can have?
2018-10-12 19:25:44	prsstnt	(a side, on their turn)
2018-10-12 19:26:18	furrykef	I don't think the exact answer is known, but I do know it's over 128... I found that out the hard way when my chess engine assumed it couldn't go over that limit.
2018-10-12 19:26:37	prsstnt	i would've guess 100 wow
2018-10-12 19:27:07	artefact	i had to up the limit in gumble from 80 to 256
2018-10-12 19:27:13	artefact	can't remember the exact position that went over 80
2018-10-12 19:27:18	artefact	but there's one
2018-10-12 19:27:57	furrykef	This position has 216 possible moves: https://lichess.org/editor/R6R/3Q4/1Q4Q1/4Q3/2Q4Q/Q4Q2/pp1Q4/kBNNK1B1_w_-_-
2018-10-12 19:28:07	prsstnt	well wouldn't you find the limit by each pawn being a queen, arranged in some optimal way on an empty (except one enemy) board?
2018-10-12 19:28:57	furrykef	You can see there's more than just queens there
2018-10-12 19:28:57	prsstnt	i will use 400 moves as my estimate, to be safe
2018-10-12 19:29:02	artefact	what makes you think that would yield the most moves?
2018-10-12 19:29:05	furrykef	256 should be enough

2018-10-12 19:29:23	furrykef	I mean, look at that position. That position would be absurdly rare and it still doesn't have 256 moves.
2018-10-12 19:29:28	prsstnt	queen has the most possible moves of any piece
2018-10-12 19:29:42	artefact	256 is overkill. you can't have more than 16 pieces with more than 16 possible moves each
2018-10-12 19:29:44	furrykef	Yes but you can have only up to 9 queens
2018-10-12 19:30:16	artefact	and having so many queens may take away some moves, prsstnt 
2018-10-12 19:30:24	artefact	if it were that easy to find, we'd have found it already
2018-10-12 19:30:30	furrykef	256 is a nice power of 2, though. But yeah, you definitely don't need more than that.
2018-10-12 19:31:28	prsstnt	i'll choose 256 then
2018-10-12 19:32:27	prsstnt	i assumed move-overlap can be exploited though
2018-10-12 19:32:38	prsstnt	like a bishop and queen going along the same line
2018-10-12 19:32:55	artefact	no... pieces can't move through each other
2018-10-12 19:33:09	prsstnt	yes but they can both choose to mvoe to the same square

2018-10-13 19:57:56	eyeoh	Down 3 pawns at the start of that, just goes to show that this level is always worth fighting even when a pawn or two down
2018-10-13 19:58:45	eyeoh	Or even a queen down if the opponent can't get their other pieces into play and that's before considering the possibilities of time pressure and blunders

2018-10-13 20:08:13	furrykef	I think the most interesting thing about my victory over Chris yesterday was I did it with the Ruy Lopez (though he took me out of book almost immediately).
2018-10-13 20:08:20	furrykef	Usually I play the London against him.
2018-10-13 20:09:59	furrykef	He played 3...Nd4 and I didn't know the line for it, so I had to improvise
2018-10-13 20:10:45	furrykef	He's one of those players with the philosophy that you should play weird moves your opponent won't be familiar with, though he usually waits a couple of moves before doing it

2018-10-13 20:23:25	furrykef	[20:11:37] Although that is partly also for practical reasons, since I'm writing Virtual Chess Coach
2018-10-13 20:23:25	furrykef	[20:11:50] So I'm learning more theory than is actually necessary at my level
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:14:13] I want to know when I lose a game, what blunder did I make ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:14:28] Is there any kind of analysis engine that can help me with that ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	artefact	[20:14:45] any engine
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:15:00] can it show me what line I should have played, etc ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:15:05] because i'm using GNU/Linux
2018-10-13 20:23:25	artefact	[20:15:06] but try to find out your mistakes without an engine before
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:15:13] artefact: really ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:15:17] It's hard
2018-10-13 20:23:25	artefact	[20:15:38] no pain, no gain
2018-10-13 20:23:25	xcombelle	[20:15:45] eyeoh: your opponent was not good at wining, it should have keep the g pawn, I won against stockfish level 8 with this plan https://lichess.org/zIlosXFF#102
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:15:55] yes but I think my mistake was during the opening
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:16:05] I did pure crap so my position was hard to stand from the beginning
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:16:22] can you suggest me an engine that would illustrate my biggest blunders ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	artefact	[20:16:36] any will work
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:16:43] really lichess doesn't help much
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:16:55] artefact: yes but i'm using GNU/Linux, is there specific software I could use ?
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:17:01] I don't know much about chess engines.
2018-10-13 20:23:25	xcombelle	[20:17:04] use lichess atchoum should be good enough http://lichess.org
2018-10-13 20:23:25	artefact	[20:17:07] it has all the features you need. no offence, but i think it's user error
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:17:35] artefact: yes, I know that mainly I don't know how to use the software. Especially, the game analysis board is hard to follow
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:17:40] I don't understand how it works.
2018-10-13 20:23:25	xcombelle	[20:18:45] did you try automatic analysis on bottom of the board on anlaysis mode ? atchoum 
2018-10-13 20:23:25	atchoum	[20:19:23] nope

2018-10-13 20:37:36	atchoum	[20:28:54] that g4 pawn was such a mistake
2018-10-13 20:37:36	bosspotato	[20:29:49] what do you mean what do I think
2018-10-13 20:37:36	atchoum	[20:30:05] Well that was the major blunder of the game, isn't it ?

2018-10-13 20:37:36	atchoum	[20:31:32] yes but the question is more like : how can I avoid playing bad moves ?
2018-10-13 20:37:36	atchoum	[20:31:40] I mean it's kind of psychological at the end
2018-10-13 20:37:36	atchoum	[20:31:53] maybe I strain too much and lose my focus in the end.

2018-10-14 01:04:57	+Momentum	agree, but not in my country, where you can't have a credit card because no support for external banking or e-banking
2018-10-14 01:05:41	+Momentum	i'd have to ask someone to register for me
2018-10-14 01:06:23	+Momentum	anyway, i asked some friend one to give me his google free tier account, but when i logged in it said unavailable in your country
2018-10-14 01:06:53	+Momentum	so RIP basically
2018-10-14 01:11:38	+Momentum	also, i don't see why they say free then ask you to enter credit card information, if i'm coming for something free then you should assume that i don't have credit card
2018-10-14 01:14:29	eyeoh	aw dang
2018-10-14 01:14:42	eyeoh	they ask for cc in case you go over limits

2018-10-14 01:17:40	eyeoh	I mean you can take it or leave it; I've personally chosen to take it because a raspberry pi on my floor is too hard to keep powered on without accidental cut
2018-10-14 01:17:48	eyeoh	and also cloud
2018-10-14 01:17:59	eyeoh	handy practise for the real world I guess

2018-10-14 01:20:26	+Momentum	but they didn't respond to my registration request either
2018-10-14 01:21:17	+Momentum	actually, the problem is not that i can't afford a basic cloud plan, the problem is that i can't send the money as i explained that's it
2018-10-14 01:21:18	eyeoh	are you under sanctions or something?
2018-10-14 01:21:26	eyeoh	I actually only have debit cards

2018-10-14 01:29:35	+Momentum	gg
2018-10-14 01:30:10	eyeoh	so how about raspberry pis though
2018-10-14 01:30:12	+Momentum	wikipedia can be biased though
2018-10-14 01:30:40	eyeoh	I'm happy to have a read of almost anything at least once
2018-10-14 01:30:55	+Momentum	i can get a raspberry PI but that won't solve most of my problems though
2018-10-14 01:31:09	eyeoh	I just find it interesting to use irc via wsl
2018-10-14 01:31:17	eyeoh	I've never tried wsl though
2018-10-14 01:31:33	eyeoh	I was briefly tempted to install it in my win10 vm under linux
2018-10-14 01:31:38	eyeoh	but too big
2018-10-14 01:32:10	+Momentum	i moved IRC to WSL because weechat on cygwin just sucks, literally sucks
2018-10-14 01:32:39	+Momentum	pain in the ass to install a simple plugin
2018-10-14 01:34:00	+Momentum	i mean just got rid of any windows terminal after i installed WSL
2018-10-14 01:34:47	eyeoh	I do have some experience with irssi in cygwin and yeah
2018-10-14 01:36:37	+Momentum	wow, irssi + cygwin = cancerous
2018-10-14 01:37:15	notzmv	agree
2018-10-14 01:37:19	eyeoh	it was a long time ago and paved the way to me dual booting linux
2018-10-14 01:37:29	eyeoh	before single booting it
2018-10-14 01:39:41	+Momentum	i was dual booting for while but i found it tedious honestly, especially when your startup time is terrible
2018-10-14 01:41:30	+Momentum	i guess the journey of cygwin will end very soon
2018-10-14 01:43:40	eyeoh	well how does putty with a raspberry pi go?

2018-10-14 03:50:46	eyeoh	bishops moving in any direction are still dangerous when least expected
2018-10-14 03:50:59	furrykef	One of the things about knights is sometimes you gotta think about them before they actually come for you. You gotta think about what pieces could be forked in the future, even if there isn't a knight ready to jump in yet.
2018-10-14 03:51:17	eyeoh	as for rooks - fairly useless in opening

2018-10-14 03:51:26	eyeoh	they're so fixed

2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[04:19:35] No, if it's rated game, no takebacks. I'm mostly talking about the games I play in chess club.
2018-10-14 13:22:14	notzmv	[04:31:51] furrykef: there's a relatively well-known set up against b4 that's really nice
2018-10-14 13:22:14	notzmv	[04:32:07] 1.b4 d5 2.Bb2 Qd6
2018-10-14 13:22:14	notzmv	[04:32:47] the natural move for white here would be 3.b5, but then black has 3...Qb4, forking the pawn and bishop
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:33:02] furrykef: ah yeah of course; take backs always good for friendlies
2018-10-14 13:22:14	notzmv	[04:33:06] so white usually plays 3.a3 and you can just play 3...e5 with a comfortable position
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:34:48] hehe a3
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:36:03] still better than f3/f6 I guess
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:36:48] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokolsky_Opening 1 b4
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:37:02] "Orangutan Opening"
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:37:19] I want to try out the hippopotamus defense for black
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[04:37:50] "The name "Orangutan Opening" originates from that game: the players visited the Bronx Zoo the previous day, where Tartakower consulted an orangutan named Susan, and she somehow indicated, Tartakower insisted, that he should open with b4."

2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[06:11:57] almost harsh to have one mistake called a blunder
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[06:13:38] Nh6 would have been nice indeed though https://lichess.org/e9Y1SEZp#24

2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:51:44] may your climb be an easy one eyeoh :)
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:52:06] goodmumble
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[06:55:00] haha thanks qed-office; I think just regular play, but not too much and all should be fresh
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:56:06] nodnod
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:56:14] how goes the calculus furrykef ?
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:57:24] I'm on the last unit of KA's AP Calculus AB course
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:57:35] I find usually what trips me up isn't the calculus but all the algebra around it...
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:58:15] oh I see
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:58:21] Like I had something like e^2x/e^2 and I simplified that to e^x... wrong
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:58:27] let me show you what people did in calculus in the 17th century
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:58:28] http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Brachistochrone.html
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:58:30] e^(2x) rather
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[06:59:44] oh dear
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[06:59:50] well, it's an easy mistake
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:00:03] true dat
2018-10-14 13:22:14	furrykef	[07:00:54] After AP Calculus AB there's the AP Calculus BC course, which doesn't add terribly much... after that I will probably do the statistics course but I will probably do it more slowly and get back to work on Virtual Chess Coach
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:01:33] one more course, one more course
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:01:51] the coach shall wait, more knowledge = better coach
2018-10-14 13:22:14	eyeoh	[07:04:10] And the wikipedia version - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve - I never knew of that until someone mentioned it; so now I seek them out when I cycle
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:12:05] help me, I need more coffee
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:12:58] how is life in brazil Synadze ?

2018-10-14 13:22:14	xcombelle	[07:45:46] and extreme right wing is supposed to win Synadze ?
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:55:31] so I am walking to get my cup of coffee, and I see two women, one with a HUGE breast, somehow I started staring and the other woman gave me a very stern look
2018-10-14 13:22:14	qed-office	[07:57:17] I blame biology, when you see such a large breast it's simply difficult to look away
2018-10-14 13:22:14	Synadze	[07:58:09] i mean
2018-10-14 13:22:14	Synadze	[07:58:12] you can look at it
2018-10-14 13:22:14	Synadze	[07:58:29] but you totes don't stare it 
2018-10-14 13:22:14	Synadze	[07:58:52] half a second max and then done
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[07:59:02] and yes xcombelle
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[07:59:22] people in brazil are way too retarded to vote correctly
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[07:59:47] now we have to choose between massive right wing retard vs totes corrupt lefty party 
2018-10-14 13:22:15	xcombelle	[08:01:02] Synadze: of what I understood lefty party is no more corrupted than the rest
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[08:01:03] i personally try not to look at women's asses / breasts 
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Aeres	[08:01:21] ...
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[08:01:26] even though it slips off from time to time
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[08:01:27] rip

2018-10-14 13:22:15	xcombelle	[08:01:44] maybe I'm wrong, but I strongly believe that it is pure propaganda from right wing
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[08:01:44] our OP duder was talking about it
2018-10-14 13:22:15	Synadze	[08:01:50] no

2018-10-14 13:22:16	xcombelle	[09:48:05] beeman your opponent is a full beginner and should be rated far under you but as there is an hard stop to 800 on the rating of lichess they can't reach their real level

2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:21:01] Ugh. Logarithms are so damn weird
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:21:59] 900 ln(25) - 900 ln(20) = 900 ln(5/4)
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:22:13] I don't know how math people can keep this stuff straight
2018-10-14 13:22:17	artefact	[11:28:25] logs make a lot of sense
2018-10-14 13:22:17	artefact	[11:28:48] everything we perceive, we perceive on a log scale
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:29:58] They sure come up a lot in calculus
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:32:50] I'm obviously going horribly wrong trying to answer this question because I get 10e - 5/2 and the answers in the list are all integers...
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:35:04] Then again it says "approximately how many"... but it still doesn't match any even if I round it to an integer
2018-10-14 13:22:17	eyeoh	[11:48:37] deeply diagon alley: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzuOFf9M7II
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:50:27] Figured it out. I added something when I should have subtracted it, and I repeated this mistake every time I went over my work until I finally caught it... ugh.
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:50:57] Basically I was doing F(5) + F(0) instead of F(5) - F(0) to compute a definite integral. :/
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[11:51:07] I knew better than that but for some reason my brain wasn't doing it right

2018-10-14 13:22:17	eyeoh	[12:13:30] "The pattern is always the same: "Fischer", who does not have an ICC handle, will make contact either directly or through a third person and then play a series of very fast blitz games ("bullet chess"), using preposterous openings and whipping the living daylights out of his opponents."
2018-10-14 13:22:17	eyeoh	[12:13:41] I looove preposterous!
2018-10-14 13:22:17	furrykef	[12:14:56] I'm pretty sure it's not known for sure that it really was Fischer.

2018-10-14 13:22:17	eyeoh	[12:19:28] a surprising long time ago
2018-10-14 13:22:17	eyeoh	[12:21:40] that weird opening started to resemble the hedgehog defense
